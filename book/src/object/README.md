# Object Model

This chapter describes the Object Model of Sui. It focuses on the theory and concepts behind the
Object Model, preparing you for a practical dive into Sui Storage operations and resource ownership.
For convenience and easier lookup, we split the chapter into several sections, each covering a
specific aspect of the Object Model.

In no way should this chapter be considered a comprehensive guide to the Object Model. It is only a
high-level overview of the concepts and principles behind the Object Model.

For a more detailed description, refer to the
[Sui Documentation](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/object-model).
