# String

While Move does not have a built-in type to represent strings, it does have two standard
implementations for strings in the [Standard Library](./standard-library.md). The `std::string`
module defines a `String` type and methods for UTF-8 encoded strings, and the second module,
`std::ascii`, provides an ASCII `String` type and its methods.

## Strings are bytes

No matter which type of string you use, it is important to know that strings are just bytes. The
wrappers provided by the `string` and `ascii` modules are just that: wrappers. They do provide
safety checks and methods to work with strings, but at the end of the day, they are just vectors of
bytes.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/move-basics/string.move:custom}}
```

## Working with UTF-8 Strings

While there are two types of strings in the standard library, the `string` module should be
considered the default. It has native implementations of many common operations, and hence is more
efficient than the `ascii` module, which is fully implemented in Move.

### Definition

The `String` type in the `std::string` module is defined as follows:

```move
// File: move-stdlib/sources/string.move
/// A `String` holds a sequence of bytes which is guaranteed to be in utf8 format.
public struct String has copy, drop, store {
    bytes: vector<u8>,
}
```

### Creating a String

To create a new UTF-8 `String` instance, you can use the `string::utf8` method. The
[Standard Library](./standard-library.md) provides an alias `.to_string()` on the `vector<u8>` for
convenience.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/move-basics/string.move:utf8}}
```

### Common Operations

UTF8 String provides a number of methods to work with strings. The most common operations on strings
are: concatenation, slicing, and getting the length. Additionally, for custom string operations, the
`bytes()` method can be used to get the underlying byte vector.

```move
let mut str = b"Hello,".to_string();
let another = b" World!".to_string();

// append(String) adds the content to the end of the string
str.append(another);

// `sub_string(start, end)` copies a slice of the string
str.sub_string(0, 5); // "Hello"

// `length()` returns the number of bytes in the string
str.length(); // 12 (bytes)

// methods can also be chained! Get a length of a substring
str.sub_string(0, 5).length(); // 5 (bytes)

// whether the string is empty
str.is_empty(); // false

// get the underlying byte vector for custom operations
let bytes: &vector<u8> = str.bytes();
```

### Safe UTF-8 Operations

The default `utf8` method may abort if the bytes passed into it are not valid UTF-8. If you are not
sure that the bytes you are passing are valid, you should use the `try_utf8` method instead. It
returns an `Option<String>`, which contains no value if the bytes are not valid UTF-8, and a string
otherwise.

> Hint: the name that starts with `try_*` indicates that the function returns an Option with the
> expected result or `none` if the operation fails. It is a common naming convention borrowed from
> Rust.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/move-basics/string.move:safe_utf8}}
```

### UTF-8 Limitations

The `string` module does not provide a way to access individual characters in a string. This is
because UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding, and the length of a character can be anywhere from 1 to
4 bytes. Similarly, the `length()` method returns the number of bytes in the string, not the number
of characters.

However, methods like `sub_string` and `insert` check character boundaries and will abort when the
index is in the middle of a character.
