# Option

`Option` is a type that represents an optional value which may or may not exist. The concept of `Option`
in Move is borrowed from Rust, and it is a very useful primitive in Move. `Option` is defined in the
[Standard Library](./standard-library.md), and is defined as follows:

```move
// File: move-stdlib/source/option.move
/// Abstraction of a value that may or may not be present.
struct Option<Element> has copy, drop, store {
    vec: vector<Element>
}
```

> The 'std::option' module is implicitly imported in every module, so you don't need to add an
> explicit import.

The `Option` type is a generic type with an `Element` type parameter. It contains a single field, `vec`,
which is a `vector` of `Element`. The vector can have a length of 0 or 1, representing the
absence or presence of a value, respectively.

The `Option` type has two variants: `Some` and `None`. The `Some` variant contains a value, while the `None` variant
represents the absence of a value. The `Option` type is used to represent the absence of a value in
a type-safe way, avoiding the need for empty or `undefined` values.

## In Practice

To showcase why the `Option` type is necessary, let's look at an example. Consider an application which
takes a user input and stores it in a variable. Some fields are required, and some are optional. For
example, a user's middle name is optional. While we could use an empty string to represent the
absence of a middle name, it would require extra checks to differentiate between an empty string and
a missing middle name. Instead, we can use the `Option` type to represent the middle name.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/move-basics/option.move:registry}}
```

In the previous example, the `middle_name` field is of type `Option<String>`. This means that the `middle_name`
field can either contain a String value, wrapped in Some, or be explicitly empty, represented by None. Using
the `Option` type makes the optional nature of the field clear, avoiding ambiguity and the need for extra
checks to differentiate between an empty string and a missing middle name.

## Using Option

The `Option` type, along with the `std::option` module, is implicitly imported in Move. This means you can use
the `Option` type directly without needing a `use` statement. You can then create an `Option` value 
using the `Some` or `None` methods.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/move-basics/option.move:usage}}
```
