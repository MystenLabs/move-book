# Move Basics

This chapter is all about the basic syntax of the Move language. It covers the basics of the
language, such as types, modules, functions, and control flow. It focuses on the language without a
storage model or a blockchain, and explains the essential concepts of the language. To learn
features specific to Sui, such as storage functions and abilities, refer to the
[Using Objects](../storage/) chapter, however, it is recommended to start with this chapter first.
