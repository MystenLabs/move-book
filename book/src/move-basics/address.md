# Address Type

Chapter: Basic Syntax
Goal: Introduce the address type
Notes:
    - a special type
    - named addresses via the Move.toml
    - address literals
    - 0x2 is 0x0000000...02

To represent [addresses](./../concepts/address.md), Move uses a special type called `address`. It is
a 32 byte value that can be used to represent any address on the blockchain. Addresses are used in
two syntax forms: hexadecimal addresses prefixed with `0x` and named addresses.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/move-basics/address.move:address_literal}}
```

An address literal starts with the `@` symbol followed by a hexadecimal number or an identifier. The
hexadecimal number is interpreted as a 32 byte value. The identifier is looked up in the
[Move.toml](./../concepts/manifest.md) file and replaced with the corresponding address by the
compiler. If the identifier is not found in the Move.toml file, the compiler will throw an error.

## Conversion

Sui Framework offers a set of helper functions to work with addresses. Given that the address type
is a 32 byte value, it can be converted to a `u256` type and vice versa. It can also be converted to
and from a `vector<u8>` type.

Example: Convert an address to a `u256` type and back.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/move-basics/address.move:to_u256}}
```

Example: Convert an address to a `vector<u8>` type and back.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/move-basics/address.move:to_bytes}}
```

Example: Convert an address into a string.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/move-basics/address.move:to_string}}
```
