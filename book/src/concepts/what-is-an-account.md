An account is a way to identify a user. An account is generated from a private key, and is identified by an address. An account can own objects, and can send transactions. Every transaction has a sender, and the sender is identified by an [address](./address.md).

Sui supports multiple cryptographic algorithms for account generation. The two supported curves are ed25519, secp256k1, and there is also a special way of generating an account - zklogin. The cryptographic agility - the unique feature of Sui - allows for flexibility in the account generation.
