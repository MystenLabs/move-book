# Advanced Programmability

In previous chapters we've covered [the basics of Move](./../basic-syntax/README.md) and [Sui Storage Model](./../programmability/README.md). Now it's time to dive deeper into the advanced topics of Sui programmability.

This chapter introduces more complex concepts, practices and features of Move and Sui that are essential for building more sophisticated applications. It is intended for developers who are already familiar with the basics of Move and Sui, and are looking to expand their knowledge and skills.
