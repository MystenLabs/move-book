# Epoch and Time

Sui has two ways of accessing the current time: `Epoch` and `Time`. The former represents
operational periods in the system and changed roughly every 24 hours. The latter represents the
current time in milliseconds since the Unix Epoch. Both can be accessed freely in the program.

## Epoch

Epochs are used to separate the system into operational periods. During an epoch the validator set
is fixed, however, at the epoch boundary, the validator set can be changed. Epochs play a crucial
role in the consensus algorithm and are used to determine the current validator set. They are also
used as measurement in the staking mechanism.

Epoch can be read from the [transaction context](./transaction-context.md):

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/epoch-and-time.move:epoch}}
```

It is also possible to get the unix timestamp of the epoch start:

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/epoch-and-time.move:epoch_start}}
```

Normally, epochs are used in staking and system operations, however, in custom scenarios they can be
used to emulate 24h periods. They are critical if an application relies on the staking logic or
needs to know the current validator set.

## Time

For a more precise time measurement, Sui provides the `Clock` object. It is a system object that is
updated during checkpoints by the system, which stores the current time in milliseconds since the
Unix Epoch. The `Clock` object is defined in the `sui::clock` module and has a reserved address
`0x6`.

Clock is a shared object, but it a transaction attempting to access it mutably will fail. This
limitation allows parallel access to the `Clock` object, which is important for maintaining
performance.

```move
// File: sui-framework/clock.move
/// Singleton shared object that exposes time to Move calls.  This
/// object is found at address 0x6, and can only be read (accessed
/// via an immutable reference) by entry functions.
///
/// Entry Functions that attempt to accept `Clock` by mutable
/// reference or value will fail to verify, and honest validators
/// will not sign or execute transactions that use `Clock` as an
/// input parameter, unless it is passed by immutable reference.
struct Clock has key {
    id: UID,
    /// The clock's timestamp, which is set automatically by a
    /// system transaction every time consensus commits a
    /// schedule, or by `sui::clock::increment_for_testing` during
    /// testing.
    timestamp_ms: u64,
}
```

There is only one public function available in the `Clock` module - `timestamp_ms`. It returns the
current time in milliseconds since the Unix Epoch.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/epoch-and-time.move:clock}}
```
