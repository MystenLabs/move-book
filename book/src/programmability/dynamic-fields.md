# Dynamic Fields

Sui Object model allows objects to be attached to other objects as _dynamic fields_. The behavior is
similar to how a `Map` works in other programming languages. However, unlike a `Map` which in Move
would be strictly typed (we have covered it in the [Collections](./collections.md) section), dynamic
fields allow attaching objects of any type. A similar approach from the world of frontend
development would be a JavaScript Object type which allows storing any type of data dynamically.

> There's no limit to the number of dynamic fields that can be attached to an object. Thus, dynamic
> fields can be used to store large amounts of data that don't fit into the object limit size.

Dynamic Fields allow for a wide range of applications, from splitting data into smaller parts to
avoid [object size limit](./../guides/building-against-limits.md) to attaching objects as a part of
application logic.

## Definition

Dynamic Fields are defined in the `sui::dynamic_field` module of the
[Sui Framework](./sui-framework.md). They are attached to object's `UID` via a _name_, and can be
accessed using that name. There can be only one field with a given name attached to an object.

File: sui-framework/sources/dynamic_field.move

```move
/// Internal object used for storing the field and value
public struct Field<Name: copy + drop + store, Value: store> has key {
    /// Determined by the hash of the object ID, the field name
    /// value and it's type, i.e. hash(parent.id || name || Name)
    id: UID,
    /// The value for the name of this field
    name: Name,
    /// The value bound to this field
    value: Value,
}
```

As the definition shows, dynamic fields are stored in an internal `Field` object, which has the
`UID` generated in a deterministic way based on the object ID, the field name, and the field type.
The `Field` object contains the field name and the value bound to it. The constraints on the `Name`
and `Value` type parameters define the abilities that the key and value must have.

## Usage

The methods available for dynamic fields are straightforward: a field can be added with `add`,
removed with `remove`, and read with `borrow` and `borrow_mut`. Additionally, the `exists_` method
can be used to check if a field exists (for stricter checks with type, there is an
`exists_with_type` method).

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move:usage}}
}
```

In the example above, we define a `Character` object and two different types of accessories that
could never be put together in a vector. However, dynamic fields allow us to store them together in
a single object. Both objects are attached to the `Character` via a `vector<u8>` (bytestring
literal), and can be accessed using their respective keys.

As you can see, when we attached the accessories to the Character, we passed them _by value_. In
other words, both values were moved to a new scope, and their ownership was transferred to the
`Character` object. If we changed the ownership of `Character` object, the accessories would have
been moved with it.

And the last important property of dynamic fields we should highlight is that they are _accessed
through their parent_. This means that the `Hat` and `Mustache` objects are not directly accessible
and follow the same rules as the parent object.

## Foreign Types as Dynamic Fields

Dynamic fields allow objects to carry data of any type, including those defined in other modules.
This is possible due to their generic nature and relatively weak constraints on the type parameters.
Let's illustrate this by attaching a few different values to a `Character` object.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move:foreign_types}}
```

In this example we showed how different types can be used for both _name_ and the _value_ of a
dynamic field. The `String` is attached via a `vector<u8>` name, the `u64` is attached via a `u32`
name, and the `bool` is attached via a `bool` name. Anything is possible with dynamic fields!

## Orphaned Dynamic Fields

> To prevent orphaned dynamic fields, please, use
> [Dynamic Collection Types](./dynamic-collections.md) such as `Bag` as they track the dynamic
> fields and won't allow unpacking if there are attached fields.

The `object::delete()` function, which is used to delete a UID, does not track the dynamic fields,
and cannot prevent dynamic fields from becoming orphaned. Once the parent UID is deleted, the
dynamic fields are not automatically deleted, and they become orphaned. This means that the dynamic
fields are still stored in the blockchain, but they will never become accessible again.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move:orphan_fields}}
```

Orphaned objects are not a subject to storage rebate, and the storage fees will remain unclaimed.
One way to avoid orphaned dynamic fields during unpacking of an object is to return the `UID` and
store it somewhere temporarily until the dynamic fields are removed and handled properly.

## Custom Type as a Field Name

In the examples above, we used primitive types as field names since they have the required set of
abilities. But dynamic fields get even more interesting when we use custom types as field names.
This allows for a more structured way of storing data, and also allows for protecting the field
names from being accessed by other modules.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move:custom_type}}
```

Two field names that we defined above are `AccessoryKey` and `MetadataKey`. The `AccessoryKey` has a
`String` field in it, hence it can be used multiple times with different `name` values. The
`MetadataKey` is an empty key, and can be attached only once.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move:custom_type_usage}}
```

As you can see, custom types do work as field names but as long as they can be _constructed_ by the
module, in other words - if they are _internal_ to the module and defined in it. This limitation on
struct packing can open up new ways in the design of the application.

This approach is used in the [Object Capability](./object-capability.md) pattern, where an application can authorize a
foreign object to perform operations in it while not exposing the capabilities to other modules.

## Exposing UID

<div class="warning">

Mutable access to `UID` is a security risk. Exposing `UID` of your type as a mutable reference can
lead to unwanted modifications or removal of the object's dynamic fields. Additionally, it affects
the [Transfer to Object](./../storage/transfer-to-object.md) and
[Dynamic Object Fields](./dynamic-object-fields.md). Make sure to understand the implications before
exposing the `UID` as a mutable reference.

</div>

Because dynamic fields are attached to `UID`s, their usage in other modules depends on whether the
`UID` can be accessed. By default struct visibility protects the `id` field and won't let other
modules access it directly. However, if there's a public accessor method that returns a reference to
`UID`, dynamic fields can be read in other modules.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move:exposed_uid}}
```

In the example above, we show how to expose the `UID` of a `Character` object. This solution may
work for some applications, however, it is important to remember that exposed `UID` allows reading
_any_ dynamic field attached to the object.

If you need to expose the `UID` only within the package, use a restrictive visibility, like
`public(package)`, or even better - use more specific accessor methods that would allow only reading
specific fields.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move:exposed_uid_measures}}
```

## Dynamic Fields vs Fields

Dynamic Fields are more expensive than regular fields, as they require additional storage and costs
for accessing them. Their flexibility comes at a price, and it is important to understand the
implications when making a decision between using dynamic fields and regular fields.

## Limits

Dynamic Fields are not subject to the [object size limit](./../guides/building-against-limits.md),
and can be used to store large amounts of data. However, they are still subject to the
[dynamic fields created limit](./../guides/building-against-limits.md), which is set to 1000 fields
per transaction.

## Applications

Dynamic Fields can play a crucial role in applications of any complexity. They open up a variety of
different use cases, from storing heterogeneous data to attaching objects as part of the application
logic. They allow for certain [upgradeability practices](./../guides/upgradeability-practices.md)
based on the ability to define them _later_ and change the type of the field.

## Next Steps

In the next section we will cover [Dynamic Object Fields](./dynamic-object-fields.md) and explain
how they differ from dynamic fields, and what are the implications of using them.
