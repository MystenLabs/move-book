# Module Initializer

A common use case in many applications is to run certain code just once when the package is
published. Imagine a simple store module that needs to create the main Store object upon its
publication. In Sui, this is achieved by defining an `init` function within the module. This
function will automatically be called when the module is published.

> All of the modules' `init` functions are called during the publishing process. Currently, this
> behavior is limited to the publish command and does not extend to
> [package upgrades](./package-upgrades.md).

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/module-initializer.move:main}}
```

In the same package, another module can have its own `init` function, encapsulating distinct logic.

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/module-initializer.move:other}}
```

## `init` features

The function is called on publish, if it is present in the module and follows the rules:

- The function has to be named `init`, be private and have no return values.
- Takes one or two arguments: [One Time Witness](./one-time-witness.md) (optional) and
  [TxContext](./transaction-context.md). With `TxContext always being the last argument.

```move
fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) { /* ... */}
fun init(otw: OTW, ctx: &mut TxContext) { /* ... */ }
```

TxContext can also be passed as immutable reference: `&TxContext`. However, practically speaking, it
should always be `&mut TxContext` since the `init` function can't access the onchain state and to
create new objects it requires the mutable reference to the context.

```move
fun init(ctx: &TxContext) { /* ... */}
fun init(otw: OTW, ctx: &TxContext) { /* ... */ }
```

## Trust and security

While `init` function can be used to create sensitive objects once, it is important to know that the
same object (eg. `StoreOwnerCap` from the first example) can still be created in another function.
Especially given that new functions can be added to the module during an upgrade. So the `init`
function is a good place to set up the initial state of the module, but it is not a security measure
on its own.

There are ways to guarantee that the object was created only once, such as the
[One Time Witness](./one-time-witness.md). And there are ways to limit or disable the upgrade of the
module, which we will cover in the [Package Upgrades](./package-upgrades.md) chapter.

## Next steps

As follows from the definition, the `init` function is guaranteed to be called only once when the
module is published. So it is a good place to put the code that initializes module's objects and
sets up the environment and configuration.

For example, if there's a [Capability](./capability.md) which is required for certain actions, it
should be created in the `init` function. In the next chapter we will talk about the `Capability`
pattern in more detail.
