# Events

Events are a way to notify off-chain listeners about on-chain events. They are used to emit additional information about the transaction that is not stored - and, hence, can't be accessed - on-chain. Events are emitted by the `sui::event` module located in the [Sui Framework](./sui-framework.md).

> Any type with the [copy](./../basic-syntax/copy-ability.md) and [drop](./../basic-syntax/drop-ability.md) abilities can be emitted as an event.

File: sui-framework/sources/event.move

```move
module sui::event {
    /// Emit a custom Move event, sending the data offchain.
    ///
    /// Used for creating custom indexes and tracking onchain
    /// activity in a way that suits a specific application the most.
    ///
    /// The type `T` is the main way to index the event, and can contain
    /// phantom parameters, eg `emit(MyEvent<phantom T>)`.
    public native fun emit<T: copy + drop>(event: T);
}
```

## Emitting Events

Events are emitted using the `emit` function in the `sui::event` module. The function takes a single argument - the event to be emitted. The event data is passed by value,

```move
{{#include ../../../packages/samples/sources/programmability/events.move:emit}}
```

The Sui Verifier requires the type passed to the `emit` function to be _internal to the module_. So emitting a type from another module will result in a compilation error. Primitive types, although they match the _copy_ and _drop_ requirement, are not allowed to be emitted as events.

## Event Structure

Events are a part of the transaction result and are stored in the _transaction effects_. As such, they natively have the `sender` field which is the address who sent the transaction. So adding a "sender" field to the event is not necessary. Similarly, event metadata contains the timestamp. But it is important to note that the timestamp is relative to the node and may vary a little from node to node.
