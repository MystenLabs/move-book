# Storage Functions

The module that defines main storage operations is `sui::transfer`. It is implicitly imported in all
packages that depend on the [Sui Framework](./../programmability/sui-framework.md), so, like other
implicitly imported modules (e.g. `std::option` or `std::vector`), it does not require adding a use
statement.

## Overview

The `transfer` module provides functions to perform all three storage operations matching
[ownership types](./../object/ownership.md) which we explained before:

> On this page we will only talk about so-called _restricted_ storage operations, later we will
> cover _public_ ones, after the `store` ability is introduced.

1. _Transfer_ - send an object to an address, put it into _account owned_ state;
2. _Share_ - put an object into a _shared_ state, so it is available to everyone;
3. _Freeze_ - put an object into _immutable_ state, so it becomes a public constant and can never
   change.

The `transfer` module is a go-to for most of the storage operations, except a special case with
[Dynamic Fields](./../programmability/dynamic-fields.md) awaits us in the next chapter.

## Ownerships and References: A Quick Recap

In the [Ownership and Scope](./../move-basics/ownership-and-scope.md) and
[References](./../move-basics/references.md) chapters, we covered the basics of ownership and
references in Move. It is important that you understand these concepts when using storage functions.
Let's do a quick recap of the most important points:

- The _move_ semantics in Move means that the value is _moved_ from one scope to another. In other
  words, if an instance of a type is passed to a function _by value_, it is _moved_ to the function
  scope and can't be accessed in the caller scope anymore.
- To maintain the ownership of the value, you can pass it _by reference_. Either by _immutable
  reference_ `&T` or _mutable reference_ `&mut T`. Then the value is _borrowed_ and can be accessed
  in the caller scope, however the owner stays the same.

```move
/// Moved by value
public fun take<T>(value: T) { /* value is moved here! */ abort 0 }

/// For immutable reference
public fun borrow<T>(value: &T) { /* value is borrowed here! can be read */ abort 0 }

/// For mutable reference
public fun borrow_mut<T>(value: &mut T) { /* value is mutably borrowed here! */ abort 0 }
```

<!-- TODO part on:
    - object does not have an associated storage type
    - the same type of object can be stored differently
    - the objects must be specified in the transaction by their ID
 -->

## Transfer

The `transfer::transfer` function is a public function used to transfer an object to another
address. Its signature is as follows, only accepts a type with the [`key` ability](./key-ability.md)
and an [address](./../move-basics/address.md) of the recipient. Please, note that the object is
passed into the function _by value_, therefore it is _moved_ to the function scope and then moved to
the recipient address:

```move
// File: sui-framework/sources/transfer.move
public fun transfer<T: key>(obj: T, recipient: address);
```

In the next example, you can see how it can be used in a module that defines and sends an object to
the transaction sender.

```move
module book::transfer_to_sender {

    /// A struct with `key` is an object. The first field is `id: UID`!
    public struct AdminCap has key { id: UID }

    /// Init function is a special function that is called when the module
    /// is published. It is a good place to create application objects.
    fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        // Create a new `AdminCap` object, in this scope.
        let admin_cap = AdminCap { id: object::new(ctx) };

        // Transfer the object to the transaction sender.
        transfer::transfer(admin_cap, ctx.sender());

        // admin_cap is gone! Can't be accessed anymore.
    }

    /// Transfers the `AdminCap` object to the `recipient`. Thus, the recipient
    /// becomes the owner of the object, and only they can access it.
    public fun transfer_admin_cap(cap: AdminCap, recipient: address) {
        transfer::transfer(cap, recipient);
    }
}
```

When the module is published, the `init` function will get called, and the `AdminCap` object which
we created there will be _transferred_ to the transaction sender. The `ctx.sender()` function
returns the sender address for the current transaction.

Once the `AdminCap` has been transferred to the sender, let's say `0xa11ce`, the sender, and only
the sender, will be able to access the object. The object is now _account owned_.

> Account owned objects are a subject to _true ownership_ - only the account owner can access them.
> This is a fundamental concept in the Sui storage model.

Let's extend the example with a function that uses `AdminCap` to authorize a mint of a new object
and its transfer to another address:

```move
/// Some `Gift` object that the admin can `mint_and_transfer`.
public struct Gift has key { id: UID }

/// Creates a new `Gift` object and transfers it to the `recipient`.
public fun mint_and_transfer(
    _: &AdminCap, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext
) {
    let gift = object::new(ctx);
    transfer::transfer(gift, recipient);
}
```

The `mint_and_transfer` function is a public function that "could" be called by anyone, but it
requires an `AdminCap` object to be passed as the first argument by reference. Without it, the
function will not be callable. This is a simple way to restrict access to privileged functions
called _[Capability](./../programmability/capability.md)_. Because the `AdminCap` object is _account
owned_, only `0xa11ce` will be able to call the `mint_and_transfer` function.

The `Gift`s sent to recipients will also be _account owned_, each gift being unique and owned
exclusively by the recipient.

A quick recap:

- `transfer` function is used to send an object to an address;
- The object becomes _account owned_ and can only be accessed by the recipient;
- Functions can be gated by requiring an object to be passed as an argument, creating a
  _capability_.

## Freeze

The `transfer::freeze` function is public function used to put an object into an _immutable_ state.
Once an object is _frozen_, it can never be changed, and it can be accessed by anyone by immutable
reference.

The function signature is as follows, only accepts a type with the
[`key` ability](./key-ability.md). Just like all other storage functions, it takes the object _by
value_:

```move
// File: sui-framework/sources/transfer.move
public fun freeze_object<T: key>(obj: T);
```

Let's expand on the previous example and add a function that allows the admin to create a `Config`
object and freeze it:

```move
/// Some `Config` object that the admin can `create_and_freeze`.
public struct Config has key {
    id: UID,
    message: String
}

/// Creates a new `Config` object and freezes it.
public fun create_and_freeze(
    _: &AdminCap,
    message: String,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
) {
    let config = Config {
        id: object::new(ctx),
        message
    };

    // Freeze the object so it becomes immutable.
    transfer::freeze_object(config);
}

/// Returns the message from the `Config` object.
/// Can access the object by immutable reference!
public fun message(c: &Config): String { c.message }
```

Config is an object that has a `message` field, and the `create_and_freeze` function creates a new
`Config` and freezes it. Once the object is frozen, it can be accessed by anyone by immutable
reference. The `message` function is a public function that returns the message from the `Config`
object. Config is now publicly available by its ID, and the message can be read by anyone.

> Function definitions are not connected to the object's state. It is possible to define a function
> that takes a mutable reference to an object that is used as frozen. However, it won't be callable
> on a frozen object.

The `message` function can be called on an immutable `Config` object, however, two functions below
are not callable on a frozen object:

```move
// === Functions below can't be called on a frozen object! ===

/// The function can be defined, but it won't be callable on a frozen object.
/// Only immutable references are allowed.
public fun message_mut(c: &mut Config): &mut String { &mut c.message }

/// Deletes the `Config` object, takes it by value.
/// Can't be called on a frozen object!
public fun delete_config(c: Config) {
    let Config { id, message: _ } = c;
    id.delete()
}
```

To summarize:

- `freeze_object` function is used to put an object into an _immutable_ state;
- Once an object is _frozen_, it can never be changed, deleted or transferred, and it can be
  accessed by anyone by immutable reference;

## Owned -> Frozen

Since the `transfer::freeze` signature accepts any type with the `key` ability, it can take an
object that was created in the same scope, but it can also take an object that was owned by an
account. This means that the `freeze_object` function can be used to _freeze_ an object that was
_transferred_ to the sender. For security concerns, we would not want to freeze the `AdminCap`
object - it would be a security risk to allow access to it to anyone. However, we can freeze the
`Gift` object that was minted and transferred to the recipient:

> Single Owner -> Immutable conversion is possible!

```move
/// Freezes the `Gift` object so it becomes immutable.
public fun freeze_gift(gift: Gift) {
    transfer::freeze_object(gift);
}
```

## Share

The `transfer::share` function is a public function used to put an object into a _shared_ state.
Once an object is _shared_, it can be accessed by anyone by a mutable reference (hence, immutable
too). The function signature is as follows, only accepts a type with the
[`key` ability](./key-ability.md):

```move
// File: sui-framework/sources/transfer.move
public fun share_object<T: key>(obj: T);
```

Once an object is _shared_, it is publicly available as a mutable reference.

## Special Case: Shared Object Deletion

While the shared object can't normally be taken by value, there is one special case where it can -
if the function that takes it deletes the object. This is a special case in the Sui storage model,
and it is used to allow the deletion of shared objects. To show how it works, we will create a
function that creates and shares a Config object and then another one that deletes it:

```move
/// Creates a new `Config` object and shares it.
public fun create_and_share(message: String, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    let config = Config {
        id: object::new(ctx),
        message
    };

    // Share the object so it becomes shared.
    transfer::share_object(config);
}
```

The `create_and_share` function creates a new `Config` object and shares it. The object is now
publicly available as a mutable reference. Let's create a function that deletes the shared object:

```move
/// Deletes the `Config` object, takes it by value.
/// Can be called on a shared object!
public fun delete_config(c: Config) {
    let Config { id, message: _ } = c;
    id.delete()
}
```

The `delete_config` function takes the `Config` object by value and deletes it, and Sui Verifier
would allow this call. However, if the function returned the `Config` object back or attempted to
`freeze` or `transfer` it, the Sui Verifier would reject the transaction.

```move
// Won't work!
public fun transfer_shared(c: Config, to: address) {
    transfer::transfer(c, to);
}
```

To summarize:

- `share_object` function is used to put an object into a _shared_ state;
- Once an object is _shared_, it can be accessed by anyone by a mutable reference;
- Shared objects can be deleted, but they can't be transferred or frozen.

## Next Steps

Now that you know main features of the `transfer` module, you can start building more complex
applications on Sui that involve storage operations. In the next chapter, we will cover the
[Store Ability](./store-ability.md) which allows storing data inside objects and relaxes transfer
restrictions which we barely touched on here. And after that we will cover the
[UID and ID](./uid-and-id.md) types which are the most important types in the Sui storage model.
