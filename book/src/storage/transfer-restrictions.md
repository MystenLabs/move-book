# Restricted and Public Transfer

Storage Operations that we described in the [previous sections](./storage-functions.md) are
restricted by default - they can only be called in the module defining the object. In other terms,
the type must be _internal_ to the module to be used in storage operations. This restriction is
implemented in the Sui Verifier and is enforced at the bytecode level.

However, to allow objects to be transferred and stored in other modules, these restrictions can be
relaxed. The `sui::transfer` module offers a set of _public\_\*_ functions that allow calling
storage operations in other modules. The functions are prefixed with `public_` and are available to
all modules and transactions.

## Public Storage Operations

The `sui::transfer` module provides the following public functions. They are almost identical to the
ones we already covered, but can be called from any module.

```move
// File: sui-framework/sources/transfer.move
/// Public version of the `transfer` function.
public fun public_transfer<T: key + store>(object: T, to: address) {}

/// Public version of the `share_object` function.
public fun public_share_object<T: key + store>(object: T) {}

/// Public version of the `freeze_object` function.
public fun public_freeze_object<T: key + store>(object: T) {}
```

To illustrate the usage of these functions, consider the following example: module A defines an
ObjectK with `key` and ObjectKS with `key + store` abilities, and module B tries to implement a
`transfer` function for these objects.

> In this example we use `transfer::transfer`, but the behaviour is identical for `share_object` and
> `freeze_object` functions.

```move
/// Defines `ObjectK` and `ObjectKS` with `key` and `key + store`
/// abilities respectively
module book::transfer_a {
    public struct ObjectX has key { id: UID }
    public struct ObjectKS has key, store { id: UID }
}

/// Imports the `ObjectK` and `ObjectKS` types from `transfer_a` and attempts
/// to implement different `transfer` functions for them
module book::transfer_b {
    // types are not internal to this module
    use book::transfer_a::{ObjectK, ObjectKS};

    // Fails! ObjectX is not `store`, and ObjectX is not internal to this module
    public fun transfer_k(k: ObjectK, to: address) {
        sui::transfer::transfer(k, to);
    }

    // Fails! ObjectKS has `store` but the function is not public
    public fun transfer_ks(ks: ObjectKS, to: address) {
        sui::transfer::transfer(ks, to);
    }

    // Fails! ObjectK is not `store`, `public_transfer` requires `store`
    public fun public_transfer_k(k: ObjectK) {
        sui::transfer::public_transfer(k);
    }

    // Works! ObjectKS has `store` and the function is public
    public fun public_transfer_ks(y: ObjectKS, to: address) {
        sui::transfer::public_transfer(y, to);
    }
}
```

To expand on the example above:

- [ ] `transfer_x` fails because ObjectK is not internal to module `transfer_b`
- [ ] `transfer_y` fails because ObjectKS is not internal to module `transfer_b`
- [ ] `public_transfer_x` fails because ObjectK does not have the `store` ability
- [x] `public_transfer_y` works because ObjectKS has the `store` ability and the transfer is public

## Implications of `store`

The decision on whether to add the `store` ability to a type should be made carefully. On one hand,
it is de-facto a requirement for the type to be _usable_ by other applications. On the other hand,
it allows _wrapping_ and changing the intended storage model. For example, a character may be
intended to be owned by accounts, but with the `store` ability it can be frozen (cannot be shared -
this transition is restricted).
