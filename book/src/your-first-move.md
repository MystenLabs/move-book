# Your First Move

In this chapter, we will build an e2e application which will demonstrate the syntax, the workflow of building a Move application, as well as process of publishing and interacting with a package. The focus of this chapter is not on diving into details of the implementation, although we will exlain some outstanding features; in the end, you will have a working application, which you can use as a playground or as a starting point for your own adventures in the world of Move and Sui.

# Hello World!

Assuming you have already [installed Sui](./before-we-begin/install-sui.md) and [set up your IDE environment](./before-we-begin/ide-support.md), let's jump right into it.

## Create a New Package

To create a new program, we will use the `sui move new` command followed by the name of the application.

> In this and other chapters, if you see the code blocks including `$` (dollar sign), it means that the following command should be run in terminal. The sign should not be included. It's a common way of showing commands in the terminals.

```bash
sui move new hello_sui
```

The `sui move` command gives access to the Move CLI - a built in compiler and test runner environment. The `new` command followed by the name of the package will create a new package in a new folder. In our case, the folder name is `hello_sui`.

```bash
$ cd hello_sui
$ tree hello_sui
```

## Directory Structure

Move CLI will create a scaffold of the application and pre-create all necessary files. Let's see what's inside.

```

```

### Manifest

The `Move.toml` file is called the [package manifest](./concepts/manifest.md), we will explain it in detail the concepts chapter. However, what is important to know is that it's the file that contains definitions and configuration for the package. Compiler uses it to read the package metadata, fetch dependencies and register _named addresses_. The latter you can see used in the `source/hello_world.move` module.

### Sources

The `sources/` directory contains the source files. Move source files have `.move` extension, and typically named after the module defined in the file. For example, in our case, the file name is `hello_world` and inside it Move CLI has already placed commented out structure:

```move
/*
module hello_world::hello_world {

}
*/
```

The file names should usually match the name of the module. And the module name has to be a valid Move identifier: alphanumeric with underscores to separate words. A common convention is to call modules in _snake_case_ - all lowercase, with underscores.

### Tests

The `tests/` directory normally contains package tests. Compiler excludes these files in the regular build process, but includes in _test_ and _dev_ modes.

### Other Folders

Also, compiler has built-in support for the `examples/` folder, the files there are treated similarly to the ones places under the `tests/` path - they're only built in the _test_ and _dev_ modes. And it is intended to be used for examples of usage of the package or its integration with other packages.

<!-- TODO: mention open-sourcing guide since it uses examples -->

## Compiling the Package

Move is a compiled language, and as such, it requires compilation of source files into Move Bytecode. The bytecode contains only necessary information about module, its members and types, and excludes comments and some identifiers (for example, for [constants](./move-basics/constants.md)).

To demonstrate these features, let's replace the contents of the `sources/hello_world.move` file with the following:

```move
/// The module `hello_world` under named address `hello_world`.
/// The named address is set in the `Move.toml`.
module hello_world::hello_world {
    // Imports the `String` type from the Standard Library
    use std::string::String;

    /// Returns the "Hello World!" as a `String`.
    public fun hello_world(): String {
        b"Hello World!".to_string()
    }
}
```

During compilation the code is _built_ but it's not _run_. A compiled package only offers functions which then can be called by other modules or in a transaction. We will explain these concepts in the [Concepts](./concepts) chapter. But now, let's see what happens when we run the `sui move build`.

```bash
# run from the `hello_world` folder
$ sui move build

# alternatively, if you didn't `cd` into it
$ sui move build --path hello_world
```

The output would be:

```
TODO: insert out
```

During the compilation, Move Compiler automatically creates a `build` folder where it places all fetched and compiled dependencies as well as the bytecode for the modules of the current package.

> If you're using a versioning system, such as Git, `build` folder should be ignored. For example, using a `.gitignore` file with `build` specified in it.

```bash
$ tree build
```

## Running Tests

Before we get to testing, we should add a test. Move Compiler supports tests written in Move and provides the execution environment. The tests can be placed in both the source files and in the `tests/` folder. Tests are marked with the `#[test]` attribute and are automatically discovered by the compiler. We explain tests in depth in the [Testing](./move-basics/testing.md) section.

Replace the contents of the `tests/hello_world_tests.move` with the following content:

```move
TODO: tests
```

Here we import the `hello_world` module, and call its `hello_world` function to test that the output is indeed the string "Hello World!". Now, that we have tests in place, let's compile the package in the _test_ mode and run tests. Move CLI has the `test` command for this:

```bash
# from `hello_world` folder
$ sui move test

# outside
$ sui move test --path hello_world
```

## Next Steps

In this section we explained the basics of the Move package: its structure, the manifest file, the build and test processes. On the next page, we will write an application and see how the code is structured and what the language can do.
