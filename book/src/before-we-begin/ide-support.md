# Set up your IDE

There are two most popular IDEs for Move development: VSCode and IntelliJ IDEA. Both of them provide
basic features like syntax highlighting and error messages, though they differ in their additional
features. Whatever IDE you choose, you'll need to use the terminal to run the
[Move CLI](./install-sui.md).

> **IntelliJ Plugin does not support Move 2024 edition, some syntax won't get highlighted.**
