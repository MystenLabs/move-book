# Set up your IDE

There are two most popular IDEs for Move development: VSCode and IntelliJ IDEA. Both of them provide basic features like syntax highlighting and error messages, though they differ in their additional features. Whatever IDE you choose, you'll need to use the terminal to run the [Move CLI](./install-sui.md).

> **IntelliJ Plugin does not support Move 2024 edition fully, some syntax won't get highlighted and not supported.**
