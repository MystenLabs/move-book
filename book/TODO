 
- Mention somewhere that whitespace is not significant (probably in blocks or comments)
- On "Address Type", is 32 bits Sui-specific?
- Endianness of address conversions is unclear
- Link to reference on addresses doesn't discuss address conversions, probably need a second link
- Enums not covered in move book
- Why is option a vector instead of an enum (in struct section)
- References haven't been introduced before they are used (in Abilities: Intro section)
- In "Abilities: Intro", summary explanation of `store` is confusing
- Link to "Type abilities" in the "Abilities: Drop; further reading" section is broken
- Abilities: drop - maybe worth mentioning that vector<T> doesn't have drop if T doesn't have drop
- Importing from another package: the relationship between addresses from imports and names in the code is a little unclear
- standard library overview: BCS should be defined
- std overview: `address` contains other stuff (e.g. to_u256) OOPS that's in sui::address
- Options: what are `borrow` and `borrow_mut`?
- Options: no demonstration of `option::none`.
- Perhaps worth moving the "Struct Methods" section into the Structs documentation; it is used a lot in the standard library docs.
- Probably borrow methods should be pulled out of option example
- `break` for nested loops?
- Code snippet at top of "Function" section is broken
- Tuples and unit are not mentioned
- except they are in the function section; are they first-class?
- the "Struct methods" section is a little vague. I get it but I'm not sure new users will

- visibility modifiers: can fields be made public?
- copyable types in ownership and scope: are they really copied when they are returned?
- type reflection: should link to `std::type_name` rather than standard library page?
- ownership: should mention that values can be owned by structs, etc..

- "what is an object": is object ownership the same as value ownership?
- object ownership: I assume single-owner objects can still be read (i.e. don't store secrets in them)
- can object ownership change?
