# Move 2024

Move 2024 is the new version of the Move language that is maintained by Mysten Labs. All of the examples in this book are written in Move 2024. If you're used to the pre-2024 version of Move, please, refer to the [Move 2024 Migration Guide](./../guides/2024-migration-guide.md) to learn about the differences between the two versions.
