# Your First Sui App

<!-- REDO chapter after we've improved CLI -->

In this chapter we illustrate the concepts of Sui by building a simple application. Unlike the [Hello World](../hello-world/README.md) example which aims to illustrate Move Compiler, this application is focused on Sui specifics. It is also more complex - it uses [objects](./../concepts/object-model.md), and we will publish and use it on Sui.

The goal of this mini-project is to demonstrate the process of building, testing, and publishing a Sui application. The result is a simple but complete application that you can use as a starting point for your projects or as a playground to experiment with Sui as you learn.

The chapter is split into the following parts (in order):

- [Hello Sui!](./hello-sui.md)
- [Build and Publish](./build-and-publish.md)
- [Testing](./testing.md)

Additionally, there's a section with ideas for further development of the application which you may get back to as you progress through the book.
