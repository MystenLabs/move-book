# Concepts

In this chapter you will learn about the basic concepts of Sui and Move. You will learn what is a
package, how to interact with it, what is an account and a transaction, and how data is stored on
Sui. While this chapter is not a complete reference, and you should refer to the
[Sui Documentation](https://docs.sui.io) for that, it will give you a good understanding of the
basic concepts required to write Move programs on Sui.
