# Further Steps

In this section you've seen how resource restrictions are represented in Move syntax. You've also learned how to create, check, access, modify and destroy resources. This part is supposed to be last in the book. However you can modify this module to your needs and think of these options:

1. Try to modify this module to support any type with generics;
2. Look through [Offer module](https://github.com/libra/libra/blob/master/language/stdlib/modules/Offer.move) and think of a way to offer collection to another account.

Full code of module Collection can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/damirka/move-book/blob/master/samples/).
