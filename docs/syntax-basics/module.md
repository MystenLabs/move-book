# Module and Import

Module is a set of functions and types packed together which the developer publishes under his address. In the previous chapters we only used scripts, though script can only operate with published modules or standard library which itself is a set of modules published under `0x1` address.

> Module is published under its sender's address. Standard library is published under `0x1` address.

> When publishing a module, none of its functions are executed. To use module - use scripts.

Module starts with `module` keyword, which is followed by module name and curly braces - inside them module contents are placed.

```Move
module Math {

    // module contents

    public fun sum(a: u64, b: u64): u64 {
        a + b
    }
}
```

> Module is the only way to publish code accessible for others; new types and resources can too only be defined within module context.

By default your module will be compiled and published from your address. However if you need to use some modules locally (e.g. for testing or developing) or want to specify your address inside module file, use `address <ADDR> {}` syntax:

```Move
address 0x1 {
module Math {
    // module contents

    public fun sum(a: u64, b: u64): u64 {
        a + b
    }
}
}
```
*Like shown in example: best practice is to keep module line without indentation*

## Imports

Default context in Move is empty: the only types you can use are primitives (integers, bool and address), and the only thing you can do within empty context is operate these types and variables while being unable to do something meaningful or useful.

To change that you can import published modules (or standard library).

### Direct import

You can use modules by their address directly in your code:

```Move
script {
    fun main(a: u8) {
        0x1::Offer::assert!(a == 10, 1);
    }
}
```

In this example we've imported module `Offer` from address `0x1` (standard library) and used its method `assert!(expr: bool, code: u8)`.

### Keyword use

To make code shorter (remember that only 0x1 address is short, actual addresses are pretty long!) and to organize imports you can use keyword `use`:

```Move
use <Address>::<ModuleName>;
```

Here `<Address>` is a publisher's address and `<ModuleName>` is a name of a module. Pretty simple. Same here, we'll import `Vector` module from `0x1`.

```Move
use 0x1::Vector;
```

### Accessing module's contents

To access imported module's methods (or types) use `::` notation. Simple as that - modules can only have one level of definitions so everything you define in the module (publicly) can be accessed via double colon.

```Move
script {
    use 0x1::Vector;

    fun main() {
        // here we use method empty() of module Vector
        // the same way we'd access any other method of any other module
        let _ = Vector::empty<u64>();
    }
}
```

### Import in script

In scripts imports must be placed inside `script {}` block:

```Move
script {
    use 0x1::Vector;

    // in just the same way you can import any
    // other module(s). as many as you want!

    fun main() {
        let _ = Vector::empty<u64>();
    }
}
```

### Import in module

Module imports must be specified inside `module {}` block:

```Move
module Math {
    use 0x1::Vector;

    // the same way as in scripts
    // you are free to import any number of modules

    public fun empty_vec(): vector<u64> {
        Vector::empty<u64>();
    }
}
```

### Member import

Import statement can be extended - you can specify which members of the module you want to import:

```Move
script {
    // single member import
    use 0x1::Signer::address_of;

    // multi member import (mind braces)
    use 0x1::Vector::{
        empty,
        push_back
    };

    fun main(acc: &signer) {
        // use functions without module access
        let vec = empty<u8>();
        push_back(&mut vec, 10);

        // same here
        let _ = address_of(acc);
    }
}
```

### Using `Self` to import module alongside its members

Small extension to member import syntax allows you to import whole module and its members. Use `Self` for module.

```Move
script {
    use 0x1::Vector::{
        Self, // Self == Imported module
        empty
    };

    fun main() {
        // `empty` imported as `empty`
        let vec = empty<u8>();

        // Self means Vector
        Vector::push_back(&mut vec, 10);
    }
}
```

### Use meets as

To resolve naming conflicts (when 2 or more modules have same names) and to shorten you code you can change name of the imported module using keyword `as`.

Syntax:

```Move
use <Address>::<ModuleName> as <Alias>;
```

In script:

```Move
script {
    use 0x1::Vector as V; // V now means Vector

    fun main() {
        V::empty<u64>();
    }
}
```

The same in module:

```Move
module Math {
    use 0x1::Vector as Vec;

    fun length(&v: vector<u8>): u64 {
        Vec::length(&v)
    }
}
```

For Self and *member import* (works in modules and scripts):

```Move
script {
    use 0x1::Vector::{
        Self as V,
        empty as empty_vec
    };

    fun main() {
        // `empty` imported as `empty_vec`
        let vec = empty_vec<u8>();

        // Self as V = Vector
        V::push_back(&mut vec, 10);
    }
}
```
