# Advanced Topics

In this section you'll learn few programming concepts which are widely used in Move: unique type system feature - [*abilities*](/advanced-topics/types-with-abilities.html), [*ownership*](/advanced-topics/ownership-and-references.html) (and how it differs from Rust's one), [*generics*](/advanced-topics/understanding-generics.html) and [*vector*](/advanced-topics/managing-collections-with-vectors.html). All of them provide solid foundation for safety and flexibility of Move language.
