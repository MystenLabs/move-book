# Foreword

When I wrote this book, there was no documentation (or other references) on the Move language and the goal I pursued was to give people a chance to see the hidden gem of crypto world - the Move language. Currently, [there is a Move documentation](https://move-language.github.io/move/) written by the language developers. Yet I still think that the flow given in this book is more intuitive and more friendly for a newcomer, I once was a newcomer too and Move is one tricky and interesting language some concepts of which might be mind-blowing.

I deeply love this language and hope you'll see why!
