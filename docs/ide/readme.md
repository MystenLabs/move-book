# Move IDE

Currently there're only few text editors with support of Move language (through extensions or packages). Those are:

- [VSCode Move Language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SDKBox.vscode-libra-move) - supports only Mvir, **outdated**
- [Atom Language Move](https://atom.io/packages/language-move) - mostly Mvir, hardly Move

And the best of all at the moment: [Move IDE for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damirka.move-ide)

## Features

As an active Move enthusiast and a guy who wrote 2 out of 3 currently available packages for Move language I gurarantee you that Move IDE for VSCode is the best option you've got. Let's see what's inside:

- Full syntax support for both Move and Mvir;
- [Move Language Server](https://github.com/dfinance/move-language-server) integrated into IDE which provides error highlights, code verification and import checks
- Fully customizable environment for your projects with ability to set custom Move dialect, use different versions of Standard Library or compiler within the directory
- It provides you with standard of organizing your Move project and aims to make this standard true
