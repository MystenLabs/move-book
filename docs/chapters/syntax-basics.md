# Syntax Basics

In this chapter you'll get to know Move language. We'll start with very simple and basic grammar rules and intensity will increase from one chapter to another. If you're a skilled developer this may seem too easy at first glance, but I do recommend you to take a closer look. If you're a beginner, then this part will give you everything you need to know about Move basics.
