# Concept

Unlike other blockchain languages (e.g. Solidity) Move proposes separation of *scrips* (or *transaction-as-script*) and *modules*. The former allows you to put more logic into your transactions and make them more flexible while saving your time and resources; and the latter allows developers to extend blockchain functionality or to implement custom *smart-contracts* with a variety of options.

In basics we'll start with scripts as they're pretty friendly for a newcomer, and then we'll get to modules.
