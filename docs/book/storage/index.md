# Using Objects

In the [Object Model](./../object) chapter we briefly explained the evolution of the Move language
from an account-based model to an object-based model. In this chapter, we will dive deeper into the
object model and explore how to use objects in your Sui applications. If you haven't read the
[Object Model](./../object) chapter yet, we recommend you do so before continuing with this chapter.
