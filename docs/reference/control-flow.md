# Control Flow

Move offers multiple constructs for control flow based on
[boolean expressions](./primitive-types/bool.md), including common programming constructs such as
`if` expressions and `while` and `for` loops, along with advanced control flow structures including
labels for loops and escapable named blocks. It also supports more more complex constructs based on
structural pattern matching.
