# Methodology

This document describes the principles and methods used to prepare, organize and evaluate the contents of the book.

## Exercises

Exercises are practices used to test the content of the page / chapter and decide on correctness.

- Who is this page / section / chapter for?
- Do we want to: introduce new piece of information? or illustrate previous points?
- Does it link previously unlinked narratives / tracks?
- Are all of the words / principles used to describe the topic familiar to reader?
- What could the reader learn on their own?
- How engaging is the content?
- What is the complexity level of the topic on a scale "trivial / moderate / complex"?
- How the complexity levels are measured?

## Open questions

- Web-format implies that the reader will jump between chapters and skip some. How strong a link to previous chapter / page should be?
-
