# Control Flow

<!--

Chapter: Basic Syntax
Goal: Introduce control flow statements.
Notes:
    - if/else is an expression
    - while () {} loop
    - continue and break
    - loop {}
    - infinite loop is possible but will lead to gas exhaustion
    - return keyword
    - if is an expression and as such requires a semicolon (!!!)

Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They are used to make decisions, to repeat a block of code, and to exit a block of code early. Sui has the following control flow statements (explained in detail below):

- `if` and `else` expressions
- `loop` and `while` loops
- `break` and `continue` statements
- `return` statement
