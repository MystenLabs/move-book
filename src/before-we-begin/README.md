# Before We Begin

This chapter covers the prerequisites for programming with the Move language: how to [set up your IDE](ide-support.md), how to [install the compiler](install-sui.md) and what the term [Move 2024](move-2024.md) refers to. If you are already familiar with these topics or have an IDE installed, you can skip this chapter and proceed to [Your First Move](../your-first-move).
