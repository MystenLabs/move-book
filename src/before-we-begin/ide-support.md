# Set Up Your IDE

There are two IDEs that are most popular for Move development: VSCode and IntelliJ IDEA. Both IDEs provide basic features like syntax highlighting and error messages, though they differ in the additional features they offer. Whatever IDE you choose, you'll need to use the terminal to run the [Move CLI](./install-sui.md).

> **IntelliJ Plugin does not support Move 2024 edition fully, some syntax won't get highlighted and is not supported.**
