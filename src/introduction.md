# The Move Book

This is a book about the Move language and the Sui blockchain platform. It is a comprehensive guide to the language and the platform, and it is intended for developers who want to learn how to write application in Move and build on Sui.

> The book is actively being developed and is a work in progress. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/move-book).

If you're looking for the Move Language Reference, it is available here: [Move Language Reference](/reference). This book refers to the reference where necessary, but it is not a replacement for it.

## Differences from the Language Reference

The flow of the book is designed to be a learning path, starting with the basics of the Move language and the Sui platform, and then moving on to more advanced topics. The book is divided into several sections, each covering a different aspect of the language and the platform.
