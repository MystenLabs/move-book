# Packages

<!--

    - packages and how they're stored
        - overview of packages and their contents (use a diagram)
        - how a package is created, and what it consists of
        - what is the package manifest
        - describe how "name" field is used
        - mention the "edition" field
        - what are the folders in a package and what are they for
        - how packages are imported (give Sui as an example)
        - what are addresses, and how they identify packages
        - how packages are published
        - leave a note that packages are also *upgradable*

Move is a language for writing smart contracts - programs that stored and run on the blockchain. A single program is organized into a package. A package is published on the blockchain and is identified by an [address](./address.md). A published package can be interacted with by sending [transactions](./what-is-a-transaction.md) calling its functions. It can also act as a dependency for other packages.

> To create a new package, use the `sui move new` command.
> To learn more about the command, run `sui move new --help`.

Package consists of modules - separate scopes that contain functions, types, and other items.

```
package 0x...
    module a
        struct A1
        fun hello_world()
    module b
        struct B1
        fun hello_package()
```

## Package Structure

Locally, a package is a directory with a `Move.toml` file and a `sources` directory. The `Move.toml` file - called the "package manifest" - contains metadata about the package, and the `sources` directory contains the source code for the modules. Packages usually looks like this:

```
sources/
    my_module.move
    another_module.move
    ...
tests/
    ...
examples/
    using_my_module.move
Move.toml
```

The `tests` directory is optional and contains tests for the package. Code placed into the `tests` directory is not published on-chain and is only availably in tests. The `examples` directory can be used for code examples, and is also not published on-chain.

## Published Package

During development, package doesn't have an address and it needs to be set to `0x0`. Once a package is published, it gets a single unique [address](./address.md) on the blockchain containing its modules' bytecode. A published package becomes *immutable* and can be interacted with by sending transactions.

```
0x...
    my_module: <bytecode>
    another_module: <bytecode>
```
