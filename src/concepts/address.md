# Addresses

Chapter: Concepts
Goal: explain locations and addresses
Notes:
    - don't talk about the type
    - packages, accounts and objects are identified by addresses
    - addresses are 32 bytes long
    - addresses are unique
    - represented as hex strings (64 characters) prefixed with 0x
    - addresses are case insensitive

Links:
    - address type


- mention what an address is, because it identifies a package
    - address is used for packages, objects, and accounts
    - address is a 32-byte value
    - address is written in hexadecimal notation
    - don't describe the type yet
    - focus on the concept of address on blockchain and on Sui in particular

Address is a unique identifier of a location on the blockchain. It is used to identify [packages](./packages.md), [accounts](./what-is-an-account.md), and [objects](./object-storage.md). Address has a fixed size of 32 bytes and is usually represented as a hexadecimal string prefixed with `0x`. Addresses are case insensitive.

```move
0xe51ff5cd221a81c3d6e22b9e670ddf99004d71de4f769b0312b68c7c4872e2f1
```

The address above is an example of a valid address. It is 64 characters long (32 bytes) and is prefixed with `0x`.

Sui also has reserved addresses that are used to identify standard packages and objects. Reserved addresses are typically simple values that are easy to remember and type. For example, the address of the Standard Library is `0x1`. Addresses, shorter than 32 bytes, are padded with zeros to the left.

```move
0x1 = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

Here are some examples of reserved addresses:

- `0x1` - address of the Sui Standard Library (alias `std`)
- `0x2` - address of the Sui Framework (alias `sui`)
- `0x5` - address of the Sui System object
- `0x6` - address of the system Clock object
- `0x403` - address of the DenyList system object
