# Your First Move

In this chapter, we will build an e2e application which will demonstrate the syntax, the workflow of building a Move application, as well as process of publishing and interacting with a package. The focus of this chapter is not on diving into details of the implementation, although we will exlain some outstanding features; in the end, you will have a working application, which you can use as a playground or as a starting point for your own adventures in the world of Move and Sui.
