For example: abort abort 42 The abort expression halts execution the current function and reverts all changes made to state by the current transaction (note though that this guarantee must be upheld by the adapter of the specific deployment of Move). There is no mechanism for \"catching\" or otherwise handling an abort. Luckily, in Move transactions are all or nothing, meaning any changes to storage are made all at once only if the transaction succeeds. For Sui, this means no objects are modified. Because of this transactional commitment of changes, after an abort there is no need to worry about backing out changes. While this approach is lacking in flexibility, it is incredibly simple and predictable. Similar to return, abort is useful for exiting control flow when some condition cannot be met. In this example, the function will pop two items off of the vector, but will abort early if the vector does not have two items use std::vector; fun pop_twice<T>(v: &mut vector<T>): (T, T) { if (v.length() < 2) abort 42; (v.pop_back(), v.pop_back()) } This is even more useful deep inside a control-flow construct. For example, this function checks that all numbers in the vector are less than the specified bound. And aborts otherwise use std::vector; fun check_vec(v: &vector<u64>, bound: u64) { let i = 0; let n = v.length(); while (i < n) { let cur = v[i]; if (cur > bound) abort 42; i = i + 1; } }","s":"abort","u":"/reference/abort-and-assert","h":"#abort","p":9},{"i":14,"t":"assert is a builtin, macro operation provided by the Move compiler.

It is replaced inside the compiler with if (condition) () else abort code assert is more commonly used than just abort by itself. The abort examples above can be rewritten using assert use std::vector; fun pop_twice<T>(v: &mut vector<T>): (T, T) { assert!(v.length() >= 2, 42); // Now uses 'assert' (v.pop_back(), v.pop_back()) } and use std::vector; fun check_vec(v: &vector<u64>, bound: u64) { let i = 0; let n = v.length(); while (i < n) { let cur = v[i]; assert!(cur <= bound, 42); // Now uses 'assert' i = i + 1; } } Note that because the operation is replaced with this if-else, the argument for the code is not always evaluated.

See Conditional Abilities and Generic Types for more details. Immutable references & and mutable references &mut both have copy and drop. This refers to copying and dropping the reference itself, not what they refer to. References cannot appear in global storage, hence they do not have store.

Pair* and MyVec* both have copy, drop, and store. All of these abilities have strong guarantees over these gated operations. The operation can be performed on the value only if it has that ability; even if the value is deeply nested inside of some other collection! As such: when declaring a struct’s abilities, certain requirements are placed on the fields. All fields must satisfy these constraints. These rules are necessary so that structs satisfy the reachability rules for the abilities given above. If a struct is declared with the ability... copy, all fields must have copy. drop, all fields must have drop. store, all fields must have store. key, all fields must have store. key is the only ability currently that doesn’t require itself. An enum can have any of these abilities with the exception of key, which enums cannot have because they cannot be top-level values (objects) in storage. The same rules apply to fields of enum variants as they do for struct fields though. In particular, if an enum is declared with the ability... copy, all fields of all variants must have copy. drop, all fields of all variants must have drop. store, all fields of all variants must have store. key, is not allowed on enums as previously mentioned.

Consider this struct declaration: public struct Cup<T> has copy, drop, store, key { item: T } It might be very helpful if Cup could hold any type, regardless of its abilities. The type system can see the type parameter, so it should be able to remove abilities from Cup if it sees a type parameter that would violate the guarantees for that ability. This behavior might sound a bit confusing at first, but it might be more understandable if we think about collection types. We could consider the builtin type vector to have the following type declaration: vector<T> has copy, drop, store; We want vectors to work with any type. We don't want separate vector types for different abilities. So what are the rules we would want? Precisely the same that we would want with the field rules above. So, it would be safe to copy a vector value only if the inner elements can be copied. It would be safe to ignore a vector value only if the inner elements can be ignored/dropped. And, it would be safe to put a vector in storage only if the inner elements can be in storage. To have this extra expressiveness, a type might not have all the abilities it was declared with depending on the instantiation of that type; instead, the abilities a type will have depends on both its declaration and its type arguments. For any type, type parameters are pessimistically assumed to be used inside of the struct, so the abilities are only granted if the type parameters meet the requirements described above for fields.

For example, we can nest two loops and use break and continue with those labels to precisely specify control flow. You can prefix any loop or while form with a 'label: form to allow breaking or continuing directly there. To demonstrate this behavior, consider a function that takes nested vectors of numbers (i.e., vector<vector<u64>>) to sum against some threshold, which behaves as follows: If the sum of all the numbers are under the threshold, return that sum. If adding a number to the current sum would surpass the threshold, return the current sum. We can write this by iterating over the vector of vectors as nested loops and labelling the outer one. If any addition in the inner loop would push us over the threshold, we can use break with the outer label to escape both loops at once: fun sum_until_threshold(input: &vector<vector<u64>>, threshold: u64): u64 { let mut sum = 0; let mut i = 0; let input_size = input.length(); 'outer: loop { // breaks to outer since it is the closest enclosing loop if (i >= input_size) break sum; let vec = &input[i]; let size = vec.length(); let mut j = 0; while (j < size) { let v_entry = vec[j]; if (sum + v_entry < threshold) { sum = sum + v_entry; } else { // the next element we saw would break the threshold, // so we return the current sum break 'outer sum }; j = j + 1; }; i = i + 1; } } These sorts of labels can also be used with a nested loop form, providing precise control in larger bodies of code. For example, if we were processing a large table where each entry required iteration that might see us continuing the inner or outer loop, we could express that code using labels: let x = 'outer: loop { ... 'inner: while (cond) { ... if (cond0) { break 'outer value }; ... if (cond1) { continue 'inner } else if (cond2) { continue 'outer } ... } ... };","s":"Loops","u":"/reference/control-flow/labeled-control-flow","h":"#loops","p":77},{"i":82,"t":"Labeled blocks allow you to write Move programs that contain intra-function non-local control flow, including inside of macro lambdas and returning values: fun named_return(n: u64): vector<u8> { let x = 'a: { if (n % 2 == 0) { return 'a b\"even\" }; b\"odd\" }; x } In this simple example, the program checks if the input n is even. If it is, the program leaves the block labeled 'a: with the value b\"even\". If not, the code continues, ending the block labeled 'a: with the value b\"odd\". At the end, we set x to the value and then return it. This control flow feature works across macro bodies as well. For example, suppose we wanted to write a function to find the first even number in a vector, and that we have some macro for_ref that iterates the vector elements in a loop: macro fun for_ref<$T>($vs: &vector<$T>, $f: |&$T|) { let vs = $vs; let mut i = 0; let end = vs.length(); while (i < end) { $f(vs.borrow(i)); i = i + 1; } } Using for_ref and a label, we can write a lambda expression to pass for_ref that will escape the loop, returning the first even number it finds: fun find_first_even(vs: vector<u64>): Option<u64> { 'result: { for_ref!(&vs, |n| if (*n % 2 == 0) { return 'result option::some(*n)}); option::none() } } This function will iterate vs until it finds an even number, and return that (or return option::none() if no even number exists).

This is true for literals, variables, and constants. For example, in the test_lit function, the value 1 matches the pattern 1, the value 2 matches the pattern 2, and the value 3 matches the wildcard _. Similarly, in the test_var function, both the value 1 and the value 2 matches the pattern y. A variable x matches (or \"equals\") any value, and a wildcard _ matches any value (but only one value).

Constructor patterns, coupled with variable bindings, allow you to match on values by their structure, and pull out the parts of the value you care about for usage on the right-hand side of the match arm. Take the following: fun f(x: MyEnum) { match (x) { MyEnum::Variant(1, true) => 1, MyEnum::OtherVariant(_, 3) => 2, MyEnum::Variant(..) => 3, MyEnum::OtherVariant(..) => 4, } f(MyEnum::Variant(1, true)); // returns 1 f(MyEnum::Variant(2, true)); // returns 3 f(MyEnum::OtherVariant(false, 3)); // returns 2 f(MyEnum::OtherVariant(true, 3)); // returns 2 f(MyEnum::OtherVariant(true, 2)); // returns 4 This is saying that \"if x is MyEnum::Variant with the fields 1 and true, then return 1.

If the series of match arms is not exhaustive, the compiler will raise an error. Note that any arm with a guard expression does not contribute to match exhaustion, as it might fail to match at runtime. As an example, a match on a u8 is exhaustive only if it matches on every number from 0 to 255 inclusive, unless there is a wildcard or variable pattern present. Similarly, a match on a bool would need to match on both true and false, unless there is a wildcard or variable pattern present. For structs, because there is only one type of constructor for the type, only one constructor needs to be matched, but the fields within the struct need to be matched exhaustively as well. Conversely, enums may define multiple variants, and each variant must be matched (including any sub-fields) for the match to be considered exhaustive. Because underscores and variables are wildcards that match anything, they count as matching all values of the type they are matching on in that position. Additionally, the multi-arity wildcard pattern .. can be used to match on multiple values within a struct or enum variant. To see some examples of non-exhaustive matches, consider the following: public enum MyEnum { Variant(u64, bool), OtherVariant(bool, u64), } public struct Pair<T>(T, T) fun f(x: MyEnum): u8 { match (x) { MyEnum::Variant(1, true) => 1, MyEnum::Variant(_, _) => 1, MyEnum::OtherVariant(_, 3) => 2, // ERROR: not exhaustive as the value `MyEnum::OtherVariant(_, 4)` is not matched. } } fun match_pair_bool(x: Pair<bool>): u8 { match (x) { Pair(true, true) => 1, Pair(true, false) => 1, Pair(false, false) => 1, // ERROR: not exhaustive as the value `Pair(false, true)` is not matched. } } These examples can then be made exhaustive by adding a wildcard pattern to the end of the match arm, or by fully matching on the remaining values: fun f(x: MyEnum): u8 { match (x) { MyEnum::Variant(1, true) => 1, MyEnum::Variant(_, _) => 1, MyEnum::OtherVariant(_, 3) => 2, // Now exhaustive since this will match all values of MyEnum::OtherVariant MyEnum::OtherVariant(..) => 2, } } fun match_pair_bool(x: Pair<bool>): u8 { match (x) { Pair(true, true) => 1, Pair(true, false) => 1, Pair(false, false) => 1, // Now exhaustive since this will match all values of Pair<bool> Pair(false, true) => 1, } }","s":"Exhaustiveness","u":"/reference/control-flow/pattern-matching","h":"#exhaustiveness","p":121},{"i":144,"t":"As previously mentioned, you can add a guard to a match arm by adding an if clause after the pattern.

Instead, to access fields within a variant -- either by value, or immutable or mutable reference -- you must use pattern matching. You can pattern match on Move values by value, immutable reference, and mutable reference. When pattern matching by value, the value is moved into the match arm. When pattern matching by reference, the value is borrowed into the match arm (either immutably or mutably). We'll go through a brief description of pattern matching using match here, but for more information on pattern matching using match in Move see the Pattern Matching section. A match statement is used to pattern match on a Move value and consists of a number of match arms. Each match arm consists of a pattern, an arrow =>, and an expression, followed by a comma ,. The pattern can be a struct, enum variant, binding (x, y), wildcard (_ or ..), constant (ConstValue), or literal value (true, 42, and so on). The value is matched against each pattern from the top-down, and will match the first pattern that structurally matches the value. Once the value is matched, the expression on the right hand side of the => is executed. Additionally, match arms can have optional guards that are checked after the pattern matches but before the expression is executed. Guards are specified by the if keyword followed by an expression that must evaluate to a boolean value before the =>. module a::m; public enum Action has drop { Stop, Pause { duration: u32 }, MoveTo { x: u64, y: u64 }, Jump(u64), } public struct GameState { // Fields containing a game state character_x: u64, character_y: u64, character_height: u64, // ... } fun perform_action(stat: &mut GameState, action: Action) { match (action) { // Handle the `Stop` variant Action::Stop => state.stop(), // Handle the `Pause` variant // If the duration is 0, do nothing Action::Pause { duration: 0 } => (), Action::Pause { duration } => state.pause(duration), // Handle the `MoveTo` variant Action::MoveTo { x, y } => state.move_to(x, y), // Handle the `Jump` variant // if the game disallows jumps then do nothing Action::Jump(_) if (state.jumps_not_allowed()) => (), // otherwise, jump to the specified height Action::Jump(height) => state.jump(height), } } To see how to pattern match on an enum to update values within it mutably, let's take the following example of a simple enum that has two variants, each with a single field. We can then write two functions, one that only increments the value of the first variant, and another that only increments the value of the second variant: module a::m; public enum SimpleEnum { Variant1(u64), Variant2(u64), } public fun incr_enum_variant1(simple_enum: &mut SimpleEnum) { match (simple_enum) { SimpleEnum::Variant1(mut value) => *value += 1, _ => (), } } public fun incr_enum_variant2(simple_enum: &mut SimpleEnum) { match (simple_enum) { SimpleEnum::Variant2(mut value) => *value += 1, _ => (), } } Now, if we have a value of SimpleEnum we can use the functions to increment the value of this variant: let mut x = SimpleEnum::Variant1(10); incr_enum_variant1(&mut x); assert!(x == SimpleEnum::Variant1(11)); // Doesn't increment since it increments a different variant incr_enum_variant2(&mut x); assert!(x == SimpleEnum::Variant1(11)); When pattern matching on a Move value that does not have the drop ability, the value must be consumed or destructured in each match arm. If the value is not consumed or destructured in a match arm, the compiler will raise an error. This is to ensure that all possible values are handled in the match statement. As an example, consider the following code: module a::m; public enum X { Variant { x: u64 } } public fun bad(x: X) { match (x) { _ => (), // ^ ERROR! value of type `X` is not consumed or destructured in this match arm } } To properly handle this, you will need to destructure X and all its variants in the match's arm(s): module a::m; public enum X { Variant { x: u64 } } public fun good(x: X) { match (x) { // OK!

'NoAbilities' does not have the copy ability The suggested declaration of make_box would be to add the copy constraint to the type parameter. This then communicates to the caller that the type must have the copy ability. macro fun make_box<$T: copy>($x: $T): CopyBox<$T> { CopyBox { value: $x } } One might reasonably ask then, why have this relaxation if the recommendation is not to use it? The constraints on type parameters simply cannot be enforced in all cases because the bodies are not checked until expansion. In the following example, the copy constraint on $T is not necessary in the signature, but is necessary in the body. macro fun read_ref<$T>($r: &$T): $T { *$r } If however, you want to have an extremely relaxed type signature, it is instead recommended to use the _ type.","s":"Type Parameters","u":"/reference/functions/macros","h":"#type-parameters","p":168},{"i":183,"t":"Normally, the _ placeholder type is used in expressions to allow for partial annotations of type arguments. However, with macro functions, the _ type can be used in place of type parameters to relax the signature for any type. This should increase the ergonomics of declaring \"generic\" macro functions. For example, we could take any combination of integers and add them together. macro fun add($x: _, $y: _, $z: _): u256 { ($x as u256) + ($y as u256) + ($z as u256) } Additionally, the _ type can be instantiated multiple times with different types. For example public struct Box<T> has copy, drop, store { value: T } macro fun create_two($f: |_| -> Box<_>): (Box<u8>, Box<u16>) { ($f(0u8), $f(0u16)) } If we declared the function with type parameters instead, the types would have to unify to a common type, which is not possible in this case. macro fun create_two<$T>($f: |$T| -> Box<$T>): (Box<u8>, Box<u16>) { ($f(0u8), $f(0u16)) // ^^^^ Error! expected `u8` but found `u16` } ... let (a, b) = create_two!(|value| Box { value }); In this case, $T must be instantiated with a single type, but inference finds that $T must be bound to both u8 and u16. There is a tradeoff however, as the _ type conveys less meaning and intention for the caller. Consider map macro from above re-declared with _ instead of $T and $U. macro fun map($v: vector<_>, $f: |_| -> _): vector<_> { There is no longer any indication of behavior of $f at the type level. The caller must gain understanding from comments or the body of the macro.","s":"_ Type","u":"/reference/functions/macros","h":"#_-type","p":168},{"i":185,"t":"The body of the macro is substituted into the call site at compile time. Each parameter is replaced by the expression, not the value, of its argument. For lambdas, additional local variables can have values bound within the context of the macro body. Taking a very simple example macro fun apply($f: |u64| -> u64, $x: u64): u64 { $f($x) } With the call site let incremented = apply!(|x| x + 1, 5); This will roughly be expanded to let incremented = { let x = { 5 }; { x + 1 } }; Again, the value of x is not substituted, but the expression 5 is. This might mean that an argument is evaluated multiple times, or not at all, depending on the body of the macro. macro fun dup($f: |u64, u64| -> u64, $x: u64): u64 { $f($x, $x) } let sum = dup!(|x, y| x + y, foo()); is expanded to let sum = { let x = { foo() }; let y = { foo() }; { x + y } }; Note that foo() will be called twice. Which would not happen if dup were a normal function. It is often recommended to create predictable evaluation behavior by binding arguments to local variables. macro fun dup($f: |u64, u64| -> u64, $x: u64): u64 { let a = $x; $f(a, a) } Now that same call site will expand to let sum = { let a = { foo() }; { let x = { a }; let y = { a }; { x + y } } };","s":"Expansion and Substitution","u":"/reference/functions/macros","h":"#expansion-and-substitution","p":168},{"i":187,"t":"In the example above, the dup macro had a local variable a that was used to bind the argument $x. You might ask, what would happen if the variable was instead named x? Would that conflict with the x in the lambda? The short answer is, no. macro functions are hygienic, meaning that the expansion of macros and lambdas will not accidentally capture variables from another scope. The compiler does this by associating a unique number with each scope. When the macro is expanded, the macro body gets its own scope. Additionally, the arguments are re-scoped on each usage. Modifying the dup macro to use x instead of a macro fun dup($f: |u64, u64| -> u64, $x: u64): u64 { let a = $x; $f(a, a) } The expansion of the call site // let sum = dup!(|x, y| x + y, foo()); let sum = { let x#1 = { foo() }; { let x#2 = { x#1 }; let y#2 = { x#1 }; { x#2 + y#2 } } }; This is an approximation of the compiler's internal representation, some details are omitted for the simplicity of this example. And each usage of an argument is re-scoped so that the different usages do not conflict. macro fun apply_twice($f: |u64| -> u64, $x: u64): u64 { $f($x) + $f($x) } let result = apply_twice!(|x| x + 1, { let x = 5; x }); Expands to let result = { { let x#1 = { let x#2 = { 5 }; x#2 }; { x#1 + x#1 } } + { let x#3 = { let x#4 = { 5 }; x#4 }; { x#3 + x#3 } } }; Similar to variable hygiene, method resolution is also scoped to the macro definition. For example public struct S { f: u64, g: u64 } fun f(s: &S): u64 { s.f } fun g(s: &S): u64 { s.g } use fun f as foo; macro fun call_foo($s: &S): u64 { let s = $s; s.foo() } The method call foo will in this case always resolve to the function f, even if call_foo is used in a scope where foo is bound to a different function, such as g. fun example(s: &S): u64 { use fun g as foo; call_foo!(s) // expands to 'f(s)', not 'g(s)' } Due to this though, unused use fun declarations might not get warnings in modules with macro functions.","s":"Hygiene","u":"/reference/functions/macros","h":"#hygiene","p":168},{"i":189,"t":"Similar to variable hygiene, control flow constructs are also always scoped to where they are defined, not to where they are expanded. macro fun maybe_div($x: u64, $y: u64): u64 { let x = $x; let y = $y; if (y == 0) return 0; x / y } At the call site, return will always return from the macro body, not from the caller. let result: vector<u64> = vector[maybe_div!(10, 0)]; Will expand to let result: vector<u64> = vector['a: { let x = { 10 }; let y = { 0 }; if (y == 0) return 'a 0; x / y }]; Where return 'a 0 will return to the block 'a: { ... } and not to the caller's body. See the section on labeled control flow for more details. Similarly, return in a lambda will return from the lambda, not from the macro body and not from the outer function. macro fun apply($f: |u64| -> u64, $x: u64): u64 { $f($x) } and let result = apply!(|x| { if (x == 0) return 0; x + 1 }, 100); will expand to let result = { let x = { 100 }; 'a: { if (x == 0) return 'a 0; x + 1 } }; In addition to returning from the lambda, a label can be used to return to the outer function. In the vector::any macro, a return with a label is used to return from the entire macro early public macro fun any<$T>($v: &vector<$T>, $f: |&$T| -> bool): bool { let v = $v; 'any: { v.do_ref!(|e| if ($f(e)) return 'any true); false } } The return 'any true exits from the \"loop\" early when the condition is met.

The following example demonstrates $s not being evaluated with an argument of foo(). maybe_s!(foo(), false) // does not abort It becomes more clear as to why it does not abort when looking at the expanded form if (false) foo() else S() However, when using method syntax, the first argument is evaluated before the macro is expanded. So the same argument of foo() for $s will now be evaluated and will abort. foo().maybe_s!(false) // aborts We can see this more clearly when looking the expanded form let tmp = foo(); // aborts if (false) tmp else S() Conceptually, the receiver for a method call is bound to a temporary variable before the macro is expanded, which forces the evaluation and thus the abort.","s":"Method Syntax","u":"/reference/functions/macros","h":"#method-syntax","p":168},{"i":193,"t":"The parameters of a macro function must always be used as expressions.

This signals to the compiler that the function is an index accessor for the specified type. Immutable Accessor​ The immutable index syntax method is defined for read-only access. It takes an immutable reference of the subject type and returns an immutable reference to the element type. The borrow function defined in std::vector is an example of this: #[syntax(index)] public native fun borrow<Element>(v: &vector<Element>, i: u64): &Element; Mutable Accessor​ The mutable index syntax method is the dual of the immutable one, allowing for both read and write operations. It takes a mutable reference of the subject type and returns a mutable reference to the element type. The borrow_mut function defined in std::vector is an example of this: #[syntax(index)] public native fun borrow_mut<Element>(v: &mut vector<Element>, i: u64): &mut Element; Visibility​ To ensure that indexing functions are available anywhere the type is used, all index syntax methods must have public visibility. This ensures ergonomic usage of indexing across modules and packages in Move. No Duplicates​ In addition to the above requirements, we restrict each subject base type to defining a single index syntax method for immutable references and a single index syntax method for mutable references. For example, you cannot define a specialized version for a polymorphic type: #[syntax(index)] public fun borrow_matrix_u64(s: &Matrix<u64>, i: u64, j: u64): &u64 { ... } #[syntax(index)] public fun borrow_matrix<T>(s: &Matrix<T>, i: u64, j: u64): &T { ... } // ERROR!

This restriction allows you to clarify the expected behavior when borrowing an indexed expression as &vec[i] versus &mut vec[i]. The Move compiler uses the mutability marker to determine which borrow form to call to produce a reference of the appropriate mutability. As a result, we disallow index syntax methods whose subject and return mutability differ: #[syntax(index)] public fun borrow_imm(x: &mut Matrix<u64>, ...): &u64 { ... } // ERROR! incompatible mutability // expected a mutable reference '&mut' return type","s":"Type Constraints","u":"/reference/index-syntax","h":"#type-constraints","p":231},{"i":246,"t":"When defining an immutable and mutable index syntax method pair, they are subject to a number of compatibility constraints: They must take the same number of type parameters, those type parameters must have the same constraints. Type parameters must be used the same by position, not name. Their subject types must match exactly except for the mutability. Their return types must match exactly except for the mutability. All other parameter types must match exactly. These constraints are to ensure that index syntax behaves identically regardless of being in a mutable or immutable position. To illustrate some of these errors, recall the previous Matrix definition: #[syntax(index)] public fun borrow<T>(s: &Matrix<T>, i: u64, j: u64): &T { vector::borrow(vector::borrow(&s.v, i), j) } All of the following are type-incompatible definitions of the mutable version: #[syntax(index)] public fun borrow_mut<T: drop>(s: &mut Matrix<T>, i: u64, j: u64): &mut T { ... } // ERROR! `T` has `drop` here, but no in the immutable version #[syntax(index)] public fun borrow_mut(s: &mut Matrix<u64>, i: u64, j: u64): &mut u64 { ... } // ERROR!

Move allows unused type parameters so the following struct definition is valid: public struct Foo<T> { foo: u64 } This can be convenient when modeling certain concepts. Here is an example: module a::m; // Currency Specifiers public struct A {} public struct B {} // A generic coin type that can be instantiated using a currency // specifier type. // e.g. Coin<A>, Coin<B> etc. public struct Coin<Currency> has store { value: u64 } // Write code generically about all currencies public fun mint_generic<Currency>(value: u64): Coin<Currency> { Coin { value } } // Write code concretely about one currency public fun mint_a(value: u64): Coin<A> { mint_generic(value) } public fun mint_b(value: u64): Coin<B> { mint_generic(value) } In this example, Coin<Currency> is generic on the Currency type parameter, which specifies the currency of the coin and allows code to be written either generically on any currency or concretely on a specific currency.

This is because of the rules for Conditional Abilities and Generic Types and the fact that A and B don't have the store ability, despite the fact that they are not even used in the body of struct Coin. This might cause some unpleasant consequences. For example, we are unable to put Coin<A> into a wallet in storage. One possible solution would be to add spurious ability annotations to A and B (i.e., public struct Currency1 has store {}). But, this might lead to bugs or security vulnerabilities because it weakens the types with unnecessary ability declarations. For example, we would never expect a value in the storage to have a field in type A, but this would be possible with the spurious store ability. Moreover, the spurious annotations would be infectious, requiring many functions generic on the unused type parameter to also include the necessary constraints. Phantom type parameters solve this problem. Unused type parameters can be marked as phantom type parameters, which do not participate in the ability derivation for structs. In this way, arguments to phantom type parameters are not considered when deriving the abilities for generic types, thus avoiding the need for spurious ability annotations. For this relaxed rule to be sound, Move's type system guarantees that a parameter declared as phantom is either not used at all in the struct definition, or it is only used as an argument to type parameters also declared as phantom. Declaration​ In a struct definition a type parameter can be declared as phantom by adding the phantom keyword before its declaration. public struct Coin<phantom Currency> has store { value: u64 } If a type parameter is declared as phantom we say it is a phantom type parameter. When defining a struct, Move's type checker ensures that every phantom type parameter is either not used inside the struct definition or it is only used as an argument to a phantom type parameter. public struct S1<phantom T1, T2> { f: u64 } // ^^^^^^^ valid, T1 does not appear inside the struct definition public struct S2<phantom T1, T2> { f: S1<T1, T2> } // ^^^^^^^ valid, T1 appears in phantom position The following code shows examples of violations of the rule: public struct S1<phantom T> { f: T } // ^^^^^^^ ERROR! ^ Not a phantom position public struct S2<T> { f: T } public struct S3<phantom T> { f: S2<T> } // ^^^^^^^ ERROR! ^ Not a phantom position More formally, if a type is used as an argument to a phantom type parameter we say the type appears in phantom position. With this definition in place, the rule for the correct use of phantom parameters can be specified as follows: A phantom type parameter can only appear in phantom position. Note that specifying phantom is not required, but the compiler will warn if a type parameter could be phantom but was not marked as such. Instantiation​ When instantiating a struct, the arguments to phantom parameters are excluded when deriving the struct abilities. For example, consider the following code: public struct S<T1, phantom T2> has copy { f: T1 } public struct NoCopy {} public struct HasCopy has copy {} Consider now the type S<HasCopy, NoCopy>. Since S is defined with copy and all non-phantom arguments have copy then S<HasCopy, NoCopy> also has copy. Phantom Type Parameters with Ability Constraints​ Ability constraints and phantom type parameters are orthogonal features in the sense that phantom parameters can be declared with ability constraints. public struct S<phantom T: copy> {} When instantiating a phantom type parameter with an ability constraint, the type argument has to satisfy that constraint, even though the parameter is phantom. The usual restrictions apply and T can only be instantiated with arguments having copy.","s":"Phantom Type Parameters","u":"/reference/generics","h":"#phantom-type-parameters","p":247},{"i":273,"t":"In the examples above, we have demonstrated how one can use type parameters to define \"unknown\" types that can be plugged in by callers at a later time.

This could be for the current module or the current expression block. However, the alias is associated to a type. The syntax for a use fun statement is as follows: use fun <function> as <type>.<method alias>; This creates an alias for the <function>, which the <type> can receive as <method alias>. For example module a::cup; public struct Cup<T>(T) has copy, drop, store; public fun cup_borrow<T>(c: &Cup<T>): &T { &c.0 } public fun cup_value<T>(c: Cup<T>): T { let Cup(t) = c; t } public fun cup_swap<T: drop>(c: &mut Cup<T>, t: T) { c.0 = t; } We can now create use fun aliases to these functions module b::example; use fun a::cup::cup_borrow as Cup.borrow; use fun a::cup::cup_value as Cup.value; use fun a::cup::cup_swap as Cup.set; fun example(c: &mut Cup<u64>) { let _ = c.borrow(); // resolves to a::cup::cup_borrow let v = c.value(); // resolves to a::cup::cup_value c.set(v * 2); // resolves to a::cup::cup_swap } Note that the <function> in the use fun does not have to be a fully resolved path, and an alias can be used instead, so the declarations in the above example could equivalently be written as use a::cup::{Self, cup_swap}; use fun cup::cup_borrow as Cup.borrow; use fun cup::cup_value as Cup.value; use fun cup_swap as Cup.set; While these examples are cute for renaming the functions in the current module, the feature is perhaps more useful for declaring methods on types from other modules. For example, if we wanted to add a new utility to Cup, we could do so with a use fun alias and still use method syntax module b::example; fun double(c: &Cup<u64>): Cup<u64> { let v = c.value(); Cup::new(v * 2) } Normally, we would be stuck having to call it as double(&c) because b::example did not define Cup, but instead we can use a use fun alias fun double_double(c: Cup<u64>): (Cup<u64>, Cup<u64>) { use fun b::example::double as Cup.dub; (c.dub(), c.dub()) // resolves to b::example::double in both calls } While use fun can be made in any scope, the target <function> of the use fun must have a first argument that is the same as the <type>. public struct X() has copy, drop, store; fun new(): X { X() } fun flag(flag: bool): u8 { if (flag) 1 else 0 } use fun new as X.new; // ERROR! use fun flag as X.flag; // ERROR! // Neither `new` nor `flag` has first argument of type `X` But any first argument of the <type> can be used, including references and mutable references public struct X() has copy, drop, store; public fun by_val(_: X) {} public fun by_ref(_: &X) {} public fun by_mut(_: &mut X) {} // All 3 valid, in any scope use fun by_val as X.v; use fun by_ref as X.r; use fun by_mut as X.m; Note for generics, the methods are associated for all instances of the generic type.

A use fun can be made public if it is declared in the module that defines the receivers type, much like the method aliases that are automatically created for functions in the defining module. Or conversely, one can think that an implicit public use fun is created automatically for every function in the defining module that has a first argument of the receiver type (if it is defined in that module). Both of these views are equivalent. module a::cup; public struct Cup<T>(T) has copy, drop, store; public use fun cup_borrow as Cup.borrow; public fun cup_borrow<T>(c: &Cup<T>): &T { &c.0 } In this example, a public method alias is created for a::cup::Cup.borrow and a::cup::Cup.cup_borrow. Both resolve to a::cup::cup_borrow. And both are \"public\" in the sense that they can be used outside of a::cup, without an additional use or use fun. module b::example; fun example<T: drop>(c: a::cup::Cup<u64>) { c.borrow(); // resolves to a::cup::cup_borrow c.cup_borrow(); // resolves to a::cup::cup_borrow } The public use fun declarations thus serve as a way of renaming a function if you want to give it a cleaner name for use with method syntax. This is especially helpful if you have a module with multiple types, and similarly named functions for each type. module a::shapes; public struct Rectangle { base: u64, height: u64 } public struct Box { base: u64, height: u64, depth: u64 } // Rectangle and Box can have methods with the same name public use fun rectangle_base as Rectangle.base; public fun rectangle_base(rectangle: &Rectangle): u64 { rectangle.base } public use fun box_base as Box.base; public fun box_base(box: &Box): u64 { box.base } Another use for public use fun is adding methods to types from other modules. This can be helpful in conjunction with functions spread out across a single package. module a::cup { public struct Cup<T>(T) has copy, drop, store; public fun new<T>(t: T): Cup<T> { Cup(t) } public fun borrow<T>(c: &Cup<T>): &T { &c.0 } // `public use fun` to a function defined in another module public use fun a::utils::split as Cup.split; } module a::utils { use a::m::{Self, Cup}; public fun split<u64>(c: Cup<u64>): (Cup<u64>, Cup<u64>) { let Cup(t) = c; let half = t / 2; let rem = if (t > 0) t - half else 0; (cup::new(half), cup::new(rem)) } } And note that this public use fun does not create a circular dependency, as the use fun is not present after the module is compiled--all methods are resolved statically.","s":"public use fun Aliases","u":"/reference/method-syntax","h":"#public-use-fun-aliases","p":291},{"i":304,"t":"A small detail to note is that method aliases respect normal use aliases. module a::cup { public struct Cup<T>(T) has copy, drop, store; public fun cup_borrow<T>(c: &Cup<T>): &T { &c.0 } } module b::other { use a::cup::{Cup, cup_borrow as borrow}; fun example(c: &Cup<u64>) { c.borrow(); // resolves to a::cup::cup_borrow } } A helpful way to think about this is that use creates an implicit use fun alias for the function whenever it can. In this case the use a::cup::cup_borrow as borrow creates an implicit use fun a::cup::cup_borrow as Cup.borrow because it would be a valid use fun alias. Both views are equivalent.

The first: [package] name = \"example_pkg\" ... [addresses] named_addr = \"_\" Declares named_addr as a named address in the package example_pkg and that this address can be any valid address value. In particular, an importing package can pick the value of the named address named_addr to be any address it wishes. Intuitively you can think of this as parameterizing the package example_pkg by the named address named_addr, and the package can then be instantiated later on by an importing package. named_addr can also be declared as: [package] name = \"example_pkg\" ... [addresses] named_addr = \"0xCAFE\" which states that the named address named_addr is exactly 0xCAFE and cannot be changed. This is useful so other importing packages can use this named address without needing to worry about the exact value assigned to it. With these two different declaration methods, there are two ways that information about named addresses can flow in the package graph: The former (\"unassigned named addresses\") allows named address values to flow from the importation site to the declaration site. The latter (\"assigned named addresses\") allows named address values to flow from the declaration site upwards in the package graph to usage sites. With these two methods for flowing named address information throughout the package graph the rules around scoping and renaming become important to understand.","s":"Declaring Named Addresses","u":"/reference/packages","h":"#declaring-named-addresses","p":313},{"i":324,"t":"A named address N in a package P is in scope if: P declares a named address N; or A package in one of P's transitive dependencies declares the named address N and there is a dependency path in the package graph between between P and the declaring package of N with no renaming of N. Additionally, every named address in a package is exported. Because of this and the above scoping rules each package can be viewed as coming with a set of named addresses that will be brought into scope when the package is imported, e.g., if you import example_pkg, that import will also bring the named_addr named address into scope. Because of this, if P imports two packages P1 and P2 both of which declare a named address N an issue arises in P: which \"N\" is meant when N is referred to in P? The one from P1 or P2? To prevent this ambiguity around which package a named address is coming from, we enforce that the sets of scopes introduced by all dependencies in a package are disjoint, and provide a way to rename named addresses when the package that brings them into scope is imported. Renaming a named address when importing can be done as follows in our P, P1, and P2 example above: [package] name = \"P\" ... [dependencies] P1 = { local = \"some_path_to_P1\", addr_subst = { \"P1N\" = \"N\" } } P2 = { local = \"some_path_to_P2\" } With this renaming N refers to the N from P2 and P1N will refer to N coming from P1: module N::A { public fun x(): address { @P1N } } It is important to note that renaming is not local: once a named address N has been renamed to N2 in a package P all packages that import P will not see N but only N2 unless N is reintroduced from outside of P.

While there are runtime address values (values of type address), they cannot be used to access modules at runtime.","s":"Address","u":"/reference/primitive-types/address","h":"","p":339},{"i":342,"t":"Addresses come in two flavors, named or numerical. The syntax for a named address follows the same rules for any named identifier in Move. The syntax of a numerical address is not restricted to hex-encoded values, and any valid u256 numerical value can be used as an address value, e.g., 42, 0xCAFE, and 10_000 are all valid numerical address literals. To distinguish when an address is being used in an expression context or not, the syntax when using an address differs depending on the context where it's used: When an address is used as an expression, the address must be prefixed by the @ character, i.e., @<numerical_value> or @<named_address_identifier>. Outside of expression contexts, the address may be written without the leading @ character, i.e., <numerical_value> or <named_address_identifier>. In general, you can think of @ as an operator that takes an address from being a namespace item to being an expression item.","s":"Addresses and Their Syntax","u":"/reference/primitive-types/address","h":"#addresses-and-their-syntax","p":339},{"i":344,"t":"Named addresses are a feature that allow identifiers to be used in place of numerical values in any spot where addresses are used, and not just at the value level.

Named addresses only exist at the source language level and will be fully substituted for their value at the bytecode level. Because of this, modules and module members should be accessed through the module's named address and not through the numerical value assigned to the named address during compilation.

Similarly, unit () is a type created by the Move source language in order to be expression based. The unit value () does not result in any runtime value. We can consider unit() to be an empty tuple, and any restrictions that apply to tuples also apply to unit. It might feel weird to have tuples in the language at all given these restrictions. But one of the most common use cases for tuples in other languages is for functions to allow functions to return multiple values. Some languages work around this by forcing the users to write structs that contain the multiple return values. However in Move, you cannot put references inside of structs.

Move is designed around the following values: Secure by default: Insecure languages are a serious barrier both to accessible smart contract development and to mainstream adoption of digital assets. The first duty of a smart contract language is to prevent as many potential safety issues as possible (e.g. re-entrancy, missing access control checks, arithmetic overflow, ...) by construction. Any changes to Move should preserve or enhance its existing security guarantees. Expressive by nature: Move must enable programmers to write any smart contract they can imagine. But we care as much about the way it feels to write Move as we do about what Move allows you to do - the language should be rich enough that the features needed for a task are available, and minimal enough that the choice is obvious. The Move toolchain should be a productivity enhancer and a thought partner. Intuitive for all: Smart contracts are only one part of a useful application. Move should understand the broader context of its usage and design with both the smart contract developer and the application developer in mind. It should be easy for developers to learn how to read Move-managed state, build Move powered transactions, and write new Move code. The core technical elements of Move are: Safe, familiar, and flexible abstractions for digital assets via programmable objects. A rich ability system (inspired by linear types) that gives programmers extreme control of how values are created, destroyed, stored, copied, and transferred. A module system with strong encapsulation features to enable code reuse while maintaining this control. Dynamic fields for creating hierarchical relationships between objects. Programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) to enable atomic client-side composition of Move-powered APIs. Move was born in 2018 as part of Facebook's Libra project. It was publicly revealed in 2019, the first Move-powered network launched in 2020. As of April 2024, there are numerous Move-powered chains in production with several more in the works. Move is an embedded language with a platform-agnostic core, which means it takes on a slightly different personality in each chain that uses it. Creating a new programming language and bootstrapping a community around it is an ambitious, long term project. A language has to be an order of magnitude better than alternatives in relevant ways to have a chance, but even then the quality of the community matters more than the technical fundamentals. Move is a young language, but it's off to a good start in terms of both differentiation and community. A small, but fanatical group of smart contract programmers and core contributors united by the Move values are pushing the boundaries of what smart contracts can do, the applications they can enable, and who can (safely) write them. If that inspires you, read on! — Sam Blackshear, creator of Move","s":"Foreword","u":"/foreword","h":"","p":634},{"i":637,"t":"Whenever execution encounters an abort, transaction fails and abort code is returned to the caller. Move VM returns the module name that aborted the transaction and the abort code. This behavior is not fully transparent to the caller of the transaction, especially when a single function contains multiple calls to the same function which may abort. In this case, the caller will not know which call aborted the transaction, and it will be hard to debug the issue or provide meaningful error message to the user. module book::module_a; use book::module_b; public fun do_something() { let field_1 = module_b::get_field(1); // may abort with 0 /* ... a lot of logic ... */ let field_2 = module_b::get_field(2); // may abort with 0 /* ... some more logic ... */ let field_3 = module_b::get_field(3); // may abort with 0 } The example above illustrates the case when a single function contains multiple calls which may abort. If the caller of the do_something function receives an abort code 0, it will be hard to understand which call to module_b::get_field aborted the transaction. To address this problem, there are common patterns that can be used to improve error handling.","s":"Better Error Handling","u":"/guides/better-error-handling","h":"","p":636},{"i":639,"t":"It is considered a good practice to provide a safe \"check\" function that returns a boolean value indicating whether an operation can be performed safely. If the module_b provides a function has_field that returns a boolean value indicating whether a field exists, the do_something function can be rewritten as follows: module book::module_a; use book::module_b; const ENoField: u64 = 0; public fun do_something() { assert!(module_b::has_field(1), ENoField); let field_1 = module_b::get_field(1); /* ... */ assert!(module_b::has_field(2), ENoField); let field_2 = module_b::get_field(2); /* ... */ assert!(module_b::has_field(3), ENoField); let field_3 = module_b::get_field(3); } By adding custom checks before each call to module_b::get_field, the developer of the module_a takes control over the error handling. And it allows implementing the second rule.","s":"Rule 1: Handle All Possible Scenarios","u":"/guides/better-error-handling","h":"#rule-1-handle-all-possible-scenarios","p":636},{"i":641,"t":"The second trick, once the abort codes are handled by the caller module, is to use different abort codes for different scenarios. This way, the caller module can provide a meaningful error message to the user. The module_a can be rewritten as follows: module book::module_a; use book::module_b; const ENoFieldA: u64 = 0; const ENoFieldB: u64 = 1; const ENoFieldC: u64 = 2; public fun do_something() { assert!(module_b::has_field(1), ENoFieldA); let field_1 = module_b::get_field(1); /* ... */ assert!(module_b::has_field(2), ENoFieldB); let field_2 = module_b::get_field(2); /* ... */ assert!(module_b::has_field(3), ENoFieldC); let field_3 = module_b::get_field(3); } Now, the caller module can provide a meaningful error message to the user. If the caller receives an abort code 0, it can be translated to \"Field 1 does not exist\". If the caller receives an abort code 1, it can be translated to \"Field 2 does not exist\". And so on.","s":"Rule 2: Abort with Different Codes","u":"/guides/better-error-handling","h":"#rule-2-abort-with-different-codes","p":636},{"i":643,"t":"A developer is often tempted to add a public function that would assert all the conditions and abort the execution. However, it is a better practice to create a function that returns a boolean value instead. This way, the caller module can handle the error and provide a meaningful error message to the user. module book::some_app_assert; const ENotAuthorized: u64 = 0; public fun do_a() { assert_is_authorized(); // ... } public fun do_b() { assert_is_authorized(); // ... } /// Don't do this public fun assert_is_authorized() { assert!(/* some condition */ true, ENotAuthorized); } This module can be rewritten as follows: module book::some_app; const ENotAuthorized: u64 = 0; public fun do_a() { assert!(is_authorized(), ENotAuthorized); // ... } public fun do_b() { assert!(is_authorized(), ENotAuthorized); // ... } public fun is_authorized(): bool { /* some condition */ true } // a private function can still be used to avoid code duplication for a case // when the same condition with the same abort code is used in multiple places fun assert_is_authorized() { assert!(is_authorized(), ENotAuthorized); } Utilizing these three rules will make the error handling more transparent to the caller of the transaction, and it will allow other developers to use custom abort codes in their modules.","s":"Rule 3: Return bool Instead of assert","u":"/guides/better-error-handling","h":"#rule-3-return-bool-instead-of-assert","p":636},{"i":645,"t":"Move 2024 is the new edition of the Move language that is maintained by Mysten Labs.

While this behavior is provided by default when working with numbers or other primitive types, it is not the default for custom types. Move is designed to express digital assets and resources, and controlling the ability to duplicate resources is a key principle of the resource model. However, the Move type system allows you to add the copy ability to custom types: public struct Copyable has copy {} In the example above, we define a custom type Copyable with the copy ability. This means that instances of Copyable can be copied, both implicitly and explicitly. let a = Copyable {}; // allowed because the Copyable struct has the `copy` ability let b = a; // `a` is copied to `b` let c = *&b; // explicit copy via dereference operator // Copyable doesn't have the `drop` ability, so every instance (a, b, and c) must // be used or explicitly destructured. The `drop` ability is explained below. let Copyable {} = a; let Copyable {} = b; let Copyable {} = c; In the example above, a is copied to b implicitly, and then explicitly copied to c using the dereference operator. If Copyable did not have the copy ability, the code would not compile, and the Move compiler would raise an error. Note: In Move, destructuring with empty brackets is often used to consume unused variables, especially for types without the drop ability. This prevents compiler errors from values going out of scope without explicit use. Also, Move requires the type name in destructuring (e.g., Copyable in let Copyable {} = a;) because it enforces strict typing and ownership rules.","s":"Abilities: Copy","u":"/move-basics/copy-ability","h":"","p":848},{"i":851,"t":"The copy ability is closely related to the drop ability. If a type has the copy ability, it is very likely that it should have drop too. This is because the drop ability is required to clean up resources when the instance is no longer needed. If a type only has copy, managing its instances gets more complicated, as the instances must be explicitly used or consumed. public struct Value has copy, drop {} All of the primitive types in Move behave as if they have the copy and drop abilities.

It evaluates a boolean expression and executes a block of code if the expression is true. Paired with else, it can execute a different block of code if the expression is false. The syntax for an if expression is: if (<bool_expression>) <expression>; if (<bool_expression>) <expression> else <expression>; Just like any other expression, if requires a semicolon if there are other expressions following it. The else keyword is optional, except when the resulting value is assigned to a variable, as all branches must return a value to ensure type safety. Let’s examine how an if expression works in Move with the following example: #[test] fun test_if() { let x = 5; // `x > 0` is a boolean expression. if (x > 0) { std::debug::print(&b\"X is bigger than 0\".to_string()) }; } Let's see how we can use if and else to assign a value to a variable: #[test] fun test_if_else() { let x = 5; let y = if (x > 0) { 1 } else { 0 }; assert!(y == 1); } In this example, the value of the if expression is assigned to the variable y. If x is greater than 0, y is assigned the value 1; otherwise, it is assigned 0. The else block is required because both branches of the if expression must return a value of the same type. Omitting the else block would result in a compiler error, as it ensures all possible branches are accounted for and type safety is maintained. Conditional expressions are among the most important control flow statements in Move. They evaluate user-provided input or stored data to make decisions. One key use case is in the assert! macro, which checks if a condition is true and aborts execution if it is not. We’ll explore this in detail shortly.","s":"Conditional Statements","u":"/move-basics/control-flow","h":"#conditional-statements","p":856},{"i":861,"t":"Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.

Loops are useful for working with collections, such as vectors, or for repeating a block of code until a specific condition is met. However, take care to avoid infinite loops, which can exhaust gas limits and cause the transaction to abort.","s":"Repeating Statements with Loops","u":"/move-basics/control-flow","h":"#repeating-statements-with-loops","p":856},{"i":863,"t":"The while statement executes a block of code repeatedly as long as the associated boolean expression evaluates to true. Just like we've seen with if, the boolean expression is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. Additionally, like conditional statements, the while loop is an expression and requires a semicolon if there are other expressions following it. The syntax for the while loop is: while (<bool_expression>) { <expressions>; }; Here is an example of a while loop with a very simple condition: // This function iterates over the `x` variable until it reaches 10, the // return value is the number of iterations it took to reach 10. // // If `x` is 0, then the function will return 10. // If `x` is 5, then the function will return 5. fun while_loop(mut x: u8): u8 { let mut y = 0; // This will loop until `x` is 10. // And will never run if `x` is 10 or more. while (x < 10) { y = y + 1; x = x + 1; }; y } #[test] fun test_while() { assert!(while_loop(0) == 10); // 10 times assert!(while_loop(5) == 5); // 5 times assert!(while_loop(10) == 0); // loop never executed }","s":"The while Loop","u":"/move-basics/control-flow","h":"#the-while-loop","p":856},{"i":865,"t":"Now let's imagine a scenario where the boolean expression is always true. For example, if we literally passed true to the while condition. This is similar to how the loop statement functions, except that while evaluates a condition. #[test, expected_failure(out_of_gas, location=Self)] fun test_infinite_while() { let mut x = 0; // This will loop forever. while (true) { x = x + 1; }; // This line will never be executed. assert!(x == 5); } An infinite while loop, or a while loop with an always true condition, is equivalent to a loop. The syntax for creating a loop is straightforward: loop { <expressions>; }; Let's rewrite the previous example using loop instead of while: #[test, expected_failure(out_of_gas, location=Self)] fun test_infinite_loop() { let mut x = 0; // This will loop forever. loop { x = x + 1; }; // This line will never be executed. assert!(x == 5); } Infinite loops are rarely practical in Move, as every operation consumes gas, and an infinite loop will inevitably lead to gas exhaustion. If you find yourself using a loop, consider whether there might be a better approach, as many use cases can be handled more efficiently with other control flow structures. That said, loop might be useful when combined with break and continue statements to create controlled and flexible looping behavior.","s":"Infinite loop","u":"/move-basics/control-flow","h":"#infinite-loop","p":856},{"i":867,"t":"As we already mentioned, infinite loops are rather useless on their own. And that's where we introduce the break and continue statements. They are used to exit a loop early, and to skip the rest of the current iteration, respectively. Syntax for the break statement is (without a semicolon): break The break statement is used to stop the execution of a loop and exit it early. It is often used in combination with a conditional statement to exit the loop when a certain condition is met. To illustrate this point, let's turn the infinite loop from the previous example into something that looks and behaves more like a while loop: #[test] fun test_break_loop() { let mut x = 0; // This will loop until `x` is 5. loop { x = x + 1; // If `x` is 5, then exit the loop. if (x == 5) { break // Exit the loop. } }; assert!(x == 5); } Almost identical to the while loop, right?

For that Move offers pattern matching syntax. This chapter doesn't intend to cover all the features of pattern matching in Move. Refer to the Pattern Matching section in the Move Reference. Pattern matching allows conditioning the logic based on the pattern of the value. It is performed using the match expression, followed by the matched value in parenthesis and the block of match arms, defining the patten and expression to be performed if the pattern is right. Let's extend our example by adding a set of is_variant-like functions, so external packages can check the variant. Starting with is_empty. /// Whether this is an `Empty` segment. public fun is_empty(s: &Segment): bool { // Match is an expression, hence we can use it for return value. match (s) { Segment::Empty => true, Segment::String(_str) => false, Segment::Special { content: _, encoding: _ } => false, } } The match keyword begins the expression, and s is the value being tested. Each match arm checks for a specific variant of the Segment enum. If s matches Segment::Empty, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

However, in some cases, such as matching on a primitive value or a collection like a vector, it's not feasible to list every possible case. For these situations, match supports a wildcard pattern (_), which acts as a default arm. This arm is executed when no other patterns match. We can demonstrate this by simplifying our is_empty function and replacing the non-Empty variants with a wildcard: public fun is_empty(s: &Segment): bool { file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/enum-and anchor=matcmove:is_empty_2}} Similarly, we can use the same approach to define is_special and is_string: /// Whether this is a `Special` segment. public fun is_special(s: &Segment): bool { match (s) { // Hint: the `..` ignores inner fields Segment::Special { .. } => true, _ => false, } } /// Whether this is a `String` segment. public fun is_string(s: &Segment): bool { match (s) { Segment::String(_) => true, _ => false, } }","s":"Trick #1 - any Condition","u":"/move-basics/enum-and-match","h":"#trick-1---any-condition","p":892},{"i":905,"t":"With the addition of is_variant functions, we enabled external modules to check which variant an enum instance represents.

For example, the ERC-20 standard in Ethereum pioneered a set of standards to interact with digital currency tokens, establishing a blueprint for creating and managing digital currencies on the blockchain. Subsequently, the introduction of the ERC-721 standard marked a significant evolution, popularizing the concept of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which represent unique, indivisible assets. These standards laid the groundwork for the complex digital assets we see today. However, Ethereum's programming model lacked a native representation of assets. In other words, externally, a Smart Contract behaved like an asset, but the language itself did not have a way to inherently represent assets. From the start, Move aimed to provide a first-class abstraction for assets, opening up new avenues for thinking about and programming assets. It is important to highlight which properties are essential for an asset: Ownership: Every asset is associated with an owner(s), mirroring the straightforward concept of ownership in the physical world—just as you own a car, you can own a digital asset. Move enforces ownership in such a way that once an asset is moved, the previous owner completely loses any control over it. This mechanism ensures a clear and secure change of ownership. Non-copyable: In the real world, unique items cannot be duplicated effortlessly. Move applies this principle to digital assets, ensuring they cannot be arbitrarily copied within the program. This property is crucial for maintaining the scarcity and uniqueness of digital assets, mirroring the intrinsic value of physical assets. Non-discardable: Just as you cannot accidentally lose a house or a car without a trace, Move ensures that no asset can be discarded or lost in a program. Instead, assets must be explicitly transferred or destroyed. This property guarantees the deliberate handling of digital assets, preventing accidental loss and ensuring accountability in asset management. Move managed to encapsulate these properties in its design, becoming an ideal language for digital assets.","s":"Move - Language for Digital Assets","u":"/object/digital-assets","h":"","p":1111},{"i":1114,"t":"Move was designed to provide a first-class abstraction for digital assets, enabling developers to create and manage assets natively.

For instance, if Alice wanted to transfer an asset X to Bob, Bob had to create a new \"empty\" resource, and then Alice could transfer asset X to Bob. This process was not intuitive and presented implementation challenges, partly due to the restrictive design of Diem. Another drawback of the original design was the lack of built-in support for a \"transfer\" operation, requiring every module to implement its own storage transfer logic. Additionally, managing heterogeneous collections of assets in a single account was particularly challenging. Sui addressed these challenges by redesigning the storage and ownership model of objects to more closely resemble real-world object interactions. With a native concept of ownership and transfer, Alice can directly transfer asset X to Bob. Furthermore, Bob can maintain a collection of different assets without any preparatory steps. These improvements laid the foundation for the Object Model in Sui.","s":"Evolution of Move","u":"/object/evolution-of-move","h":"","p":1117},{"i":1120,"t":"Move's initial storage model was not well-suited for managing digital assets, requiring complex and restrictive transfer operations.

This requires a system for sequencing and validating transactions to support the network's consistency. Sui addresses this challenge through a consensus mechanism, ensuring all nodes agree on the transactions' sequence and state. Consider a marketplace scenario where Alice and Bob simultaneously attempt to purchase the same asset.

This is known as the fast path execution, where transactions accessing account-owned objects are processed quickly without the need for extensive consensus. No concurrent data access -> simpler challenge -> fast path. Another ownership model that allows for fast path execution is the immutable state.

These objects have their own type and associated behaviors, a unique identifier, and support native storage operations like transfer and share. Designed to be intuitive and easy to use, the Object Model enables a wide range of use cases to be implemented with ease. Objects in Sui have the following properties: Type: Every object has a type, defining the structure and behavior of the object. Objects of different types cannot be mixed or used interchangeably, ensuring objects are used correctly according to their type system. Unique ID: Each object has a unique identifier, distinguishing it from other objects. This ID is generated upon the object's creation and is immutable. It's used to track and identify objects within the system. Owner: Every object is associated with an owner, who has control over changes to the object. Ownership on Sui can be exclusive to an account, shared across the network, or frozen, allowing read-only access without modification or transfer capabilities. We will discuss ownership in more detail in the following sections. Note that ownership does not control the confidentiality of an object — it is always possible to read the contents of an on-chain object from outside of Move. You should never store unencrypted secrets inside of objects. Data: Objects encapsulate their data, simplifying management and manipulation. The data structure and operations are defined by the object's type. Version: The transition from accounts to objects is facilitated by object versioning. Traditionally, blockchains use a nonce to prevent replay attacks. In Sui, the object's version acts as a nonce, preventing replay attacks for each object. Digest: Every object has a digest, which is a hash of the object's data. The digest is used to cryptographically verify the integrity of the object's data and ensures that it has not been tampered with. The digest is calculated when the object is created and is updated whenever the object's data changes.","s":"What is an Object?","u":"/object/object-model","h":"","p":1135},{"i":1138,"t":"Objects in Sui are high-level abstractions representing digital assets.

Here, an object is owned by a single account, granting that account exclusive control over the object within the behaviors associated with its type. This model embodies the concept of true ownership, where the account possesses complete authority over the object, making it inaccessible to others for modification or transfer. This level of ownership clarity is a significant advantage over other blockchain systems, where ownership definitions can be more ambiguous, and smart contracts may have the ability to alter or transfer assets without the owner's consent.","s":"Account Owner (or Single Owner)","u":"/object/ownership","h":"#account-owner-or-single-owner","p":1142},{"i":1147,"t":"Single owner model has its limitations: for example, it is very tricky to implement a marketplace for digital assets without a shared state. For a generic marketplace scenario, imagine that Alice owns an asset X, and she wants to sell it by putting it into a shared marketplace. Then Bob can come and buy the asset directly from the marketplace. The reason why this is tricky is that it is impossible to write a smart contract that would \"lock\" the asset in Alice's account and take it out when Bob buys it. First, it will be a violation of the single owner model, and second, it requires a shared access to the asset. To facilitate a problem of shared data access, Sui has introduced a shared ownership model. In this model, an object can be shared with the network. Shared objects can be read and modified by any account on the network, and the rules of interaction are defined by the implementation of the object. Typical uses for shared objects are: marketplaces, shared resources, escrows, and other scenarios where multiple accounts need access to the same state.","s":"Shared State","u":"/object/ownership","h":"#shared-state","p":1142},{"i":1149,"t":"Sui also offers the frozen object model, where an object becomes permanently read-only.

A use case we love to mention is a game character. Alice can own the Hero object from a game, and the Hero can own items: also represented as objects, like a \"Map\", or a \"Compass\". Alice may take the \"Map\" from the \"Hero\" object, and then send it to Bob, or sell it on a marketplace.

And in other smart-contract languages, authorization is often performed by checking the address of the sender. This pattern is still viable on Sui, however, overall recommendation is to use capabilities for better security, discoverability, and code organization. Let's look at how the new function that creates a user would look like if it was using the address check: /// Error code for unauthorized access. const ENotAuthorized: u64 = 0; /// The application admin address. const APPLICATION_ADMIN: address = @0xa11ce; /// Creates a new user in the system. Requires the sender to be the application /// admin. public fun new(ctx: &mut TxContext): User { assert!(ctx.sender() == APPLICATION_ADMIN, ENotAuthorized); User { id: object::new(ctx) } } And now, let's see how the same function would look like with the capability: /// Grants the owner the right to create new users in the system. public struct AdminCap {} /// Creates a new user in the system. Requires the `AdminCap` capability to be /// passed as the first argument. public fun new(_: &AdminCap, ctx: &mut TxContext): User { User { id: object::new(ctx) } } Using capabilities has several advantages over the address check: Migration of admin rights is easier with capabilities due to them being objects. In case of address, if the admin address changes, all the functions that check the address need to be updated - hence, require a package upgrade. Function signatures are more descriptive with capabilities. It is clear that the new function requires the AdminCap to be passed as an argument. And this function can't be called without it. Object Capabilities don't require extra checks in the function body, and hence, decrease the chance of a developer mistake. An owned Capability also serves in discovery. The owner of the AdminCap can see the object in their account (via a Wallet or Explorer), and know that they have the admin rights. This is less transparent with the address check. However, the address approach has its own advantages. For example, if an address is multisig, and transaction building gets more complex, it might be easier to check the address. Also, if there's a central object of the application that is used in every function, it can store the admin address, and this would simplify migration. The central object approach is also valuable for revokable capabilities, where the admin can revoke the capability from the user.","s":"Address Check vs Capability","u":"/programmability/capability","h":"#address-check-vs-capability","p":1159},{"i":1168,"t":"Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS) is a binary encoding format for structured data.

In other words, if an instance of a type is passed to a function by value, it is moved to the function scope and can't be accessed in the caller scope anymore. To maintain the ownership of the value, you can pass it by reference. Either by immutable reference &T or mutable reference &mut T.

Its signature is as follows, only accepts a type with the key ability and an address of the recipient. Please, note that the object is passed into the function by value, therefore it is moved to the function scope and then moved to the recipient address: module sui::transfer; public fun transfer<T: key>(obj: T, recipient: address); In the next example, you can see how it can be used in a module that defines and sends an object to the transaction sender. module book::transfer_to_sender; /// A struct with `key` is an object. The first field is `id: UID`! public struct AdminCap has key { id: UID } /// `init` function is a special function that is called when the module /// is published. It is a good place to create application objects. fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) { // Create a new `AdminCap` object, in this scope. let admin_cap = AdminCap { id: object::new(ctx) }; // Transfer the object to the transaction sender. transfer::transfer(admin_cap, ctx.sender()); // admin_cap is gone! Can't be accessed anymore. } /// Transfers the `AdminCap` object to the `recipient`. Thus, the recipient /// becomes the owner of the object, and only they can access it. public fun transfer_admin_cap(cap: AdminCap, recipient: address) { transfer::transfer(cap, recipient); } When the module is published, the init function will get called, and the AdminCap object which we created there will be transferred to the transaction sender. The ctx.sender() function returns the sender address for the current transaction. Once the AdminCap has been transferred to the sender, for example, to 0xa11ce, the sender, and only the sender, will be able to access the object. The object is now account owned. Account owned objects are a subject to true ownership - only the account owner can access them. This is a fundamental concept in the Sui storage model. Let's extend the example with a function that uses AdminCap to authorize a mint of a new object and its transfer to another address: /// Some `Gift` object that the admin can `mint_and_transfer`. public struct Gift has key { id: UID } /// Creates a new `Gift` object and transfers it to the `recipient`. public fun mint_and_transfer( _: &AdminCap, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext ) { let gift = Gift { id: object::new(ctx) }; transfer::transfer(gift, recipient); } The mint_and_transfer function is a public function that \"could\" be called by anyone, but it requires an AdminCap object to be passed as the first argument by reference. Without it, the function will not be callable. This is a simple way to restrict access to privileged functions called Capability. Because the AdminCap object is account owned, only 0xa11ce will be able to call the mint_and_transfer function. The Gifts sent to recipients will also be account owned, each gift being unique and owned exclusively by the recipient. A quick recap: transfer function is used to send an object to an address; The object becomes account owned and can only be accessed by the recipient; Functions can be gated by requiring an object to be passed as an argument, creating a capability.","s":"Transfer","u":"/storage/storage-functions","h":"#transfer","p":1399},{"i":1408,"t":"The transfer::freeze_object function is a public function that is used to put an object into an immutable state.

Just like all other storage functions, it takes the object by value: module sui::transfer; public fun freeze_object<T: key>(obj: T); Let's expand on the previous example and add a function that allows the admin to create a Config object and freeze it: /// Some `Config` object that the admin can `create_and_freeze`. public struct Config has key { id: UID, message: String } /// Creates a new `Config` object and freezes it. public fun create_and_freeze( _: &AdminCap, message: String, ctx: &mut TxContext ) { let config = Config { id: object::new(ctx), message }; // Freeze the object so it becomes immutable. transfer::freeze_object(config); } /// Returns the message from the `Config` object. /// Can access the object by immutable reference! public fun message(c: &Config): String { c.message } Config is an object that has a message field, and the create_and_freeze function creates a new Config and freezes it.

Config is now publicly available by its ID, and the message can be read by anyone. Function definitions are not connected to the object's state.

Parameters that follow it define the actual commands and actions that the transaction will perform. The first two calls we make are utility calls to set the sender address to the command inputs and set the gas budget for the transaction. # sets the gas budget for the transaction --gas-budget 100000000 \\n # registers a variable \"sender=@...\" --assign sender @$MY_ADDRESS \\n Then we perform the actual call to a function in the package. We use the --move-call followed by the package ID, the module name, and the function name. In this case, we are calling the new function in the todo_list package. # calls the \"new\" function in the \"todo_list\" package under the $PACKAGE_ID address --move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::new The function that we defined actually returns a value, which we want need to store. We use the --assign command to give a name to the returned value. In this case, we are calling it list. And then we transfer the object to our account. --move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::new \\ # assigns the result of the \"new\" function to the \"list\" variable (from the previous step) --assign list \\ # transfers the object to the sender --transfer-objects \"[list]\" sender Once the command is constructed, you can run it in the terminal.

If everything is correct, you should see the output similar to the one we had in previous sections. Now you can check the list object to see if the item was added. $ sui client object $LIST_ID The output should contain the item that you have added. ╭───────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ objectId │ 0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553 │ │ version │ 24 │ │ digest │ FGcXH8MGpMs5BdTnC62CQ3VLAwwexYg2id5DKU7Jr9aQ │ │ objType │ 0x468daa33dfcb3e17162bbc8928f6ec73744bb08d838d1b6eb94eac99269b29fe::todo_list::TodoList │ │ owner │ ╭──────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ │ │ AddressOwner │ 0x091ef55506ad814920adcef32045f9078f2f6e9a72f4cf253a1e6274157380a1 │ │ │ │ ╰──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │ │ prevTx │ EJVK6FEHtfTdCuGkNsU1HcrmUBEN6H6jshfcptnw8Yt1 │ │ storageRebate │ 1558000 │ │ content │ ╭───────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ │ │ dataType │ moveObject │ │ │ │ │ type │ 0x468daa33dfcb3e17162bbc8928f6ec73744bb08d838d1b6eb94eac99269b29fe::todo_list::TodoList │ │ │ │ │ hasPublicTransfer │ true │ │ │ │ │ fields │ ╭───────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ id │ ╭────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ id │ 0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553 │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ╰────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ items │ ╭─────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ finish the Hello, Sui chapter │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ╰─────────────────────────────────╯ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ╰───────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │ │ │ │ ╰───────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │ ╰───────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ A JSON representation of the object can be obtained by adding the --json flag to the command. $ sui client object $LIST_ID --json { \"objectId\": \"0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553\", \"version\": \"24\", \"digest\": \"FGcXH8MGpMs5BdTnC62CQ3VLAwwexYg2id5DKU7Jr9aQ\", \"type\": \"0x468daa33dfcb3e17162bbc8928f6ec73744bb08d838d1b6eb94eac99269b29fe::todo_list::TodoList\", \"owner\": { \"AddressOwner\": \"0x091ef55506ad814920adcef32045f9078f2f6e9a72f4cf253a1e6274157380a1\" }, \"previousTransaction\": \"EJVK6FEHtfTdCuGkNsU1HcrmUBEN6H6jshfcptnw8Yt1\", \"storageRebate\": \"1558000\", \"content\": { \"dataType\": \"moveObject\", \"type\": \"0x468daa33dfcb3e17162bbc8928f6ec73744bb08d838d1b6eb94eac99269b29fe::todo_list::TodoList\", \"hasPublicTransfer\": true, \"fields\": { \"id\": { \"id\": \"0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553\" }, \"items\": [\"Finish the Hello, Sui chapter\"] } } }","s":"Passing Objects to Functions","u":"/your-first-move/hello-sui","h":"#passing-objects-to-functions","p":1473},{"i":1510,"t":"You can chain multiple commands in a single transaction.
